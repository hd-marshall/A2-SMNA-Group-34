"iWS3oVeyjL4","Great review, but actually for Ayo Edebri's beaded portion of the dress, I think it's more of a homage to her Nigerian roots. Such red beading is symbolic of a lot of tribes, particularly Ibo traditional wear, so I don't see anything European about it. But maybe it's because I'm looking at it from an African lens, given that dandyism has African roots.","@justinaadk5081","0","2025-05-14","00:00:00","2025","2025"

"iWS3oVeyjL4","17:20 Idc if it makes me a prude, I don't think exposing your junk below the belt should be acceptable and should get these celebs expelled from events. 
There is a massive difference between exposing your chest and exposing your genitals. One is either already socially acceptable or commentary on the inequality of the sexes and one would be illegal under any other circumstances for any other person. Simply accepting celebrities exposing their genitals to us reminds me a little too much of situations where people are made to feel they just have to accept a person in a position of power/control abusing them because that person has power/control. That sort of dynamic shouldn't be normalized. 
These celebs are doing this to attract attention and provoke public discussion about them, AND to exert their power and control over everyone there. So stop allowing them to have that moment to gain attention for abusing their power.","@gneissnicebaby","0","2025-05-13","00:00:00","2025","2025"

"iWS3oVeyjL4","To me, Black dandyism incorporates not only originality in suiting but it's reinvention, taking the costume of the oppresser, and elevating it to an artform. It's an original and unapologetic embrace of cultural, feminine and masculine while playing with volume, color and texture, to infuse a sense of anachronistic style (while referencing history). This assignment is an advanced one, difficult for people who are dressed by others who don't have a confidence in their own personal expression or, who just don't get its depth (for ex. a suit, or suit inspired piece- Kendall Jenner, Beiber, Usher et. al) or who just don't get it at all (Gigi Haddid, Nicole Kidman, Anne Hathaway etc). People who got it: Colman Domingo, Rihanna , Zendaya, Dapper Dan, Doja Cat, Jodi Turner Smith, LaKeith Stanfield, Tessa Thompson, Lewis Hamilton, Lupita Nyongo too many to list.

"iWS3oVeyjL4","Joe W. Notes: I really have enjoyed this video. I saw pics from the event which intrigued me before I even saw THIS.
I have seen other videos and clips from the Same Creator which I've Enjoyed... LOVE THIS YEAR'S THEME AND ITS INSPIRATION!
Also: Very Good Analysis!
Appreciation for Culture that brings African sensibilities in to play with European traditionalism.

Having said that... I was not excited to see the pixelization
On certain images. I understand that pelvic zones and breast/nipple views are pixilated and I understand WHY... and I am aware that slavery contributed to the sexualization and associated commodification of dark-skinned Bodies in ways that are STILL playing out in our culture Today... But looking at a woman's exposed breast(s) and thinking, 'Oh! It's a Nod to the historic ""slave as Wet-Nurse"" phenomena' just kind of made me Sad... I guess it should have made me Angry too - then we could call this 'Provocative' Fashion [like Alexander McQueen's ""Highland Rape"" Collection] but for me the TakeAway was Just SAD.
And Halle Berry... REALLY?
[Yes. I saw ""Monster's Ball"" and I remember it. Heck - Just yesterday I drove past a kid walking home from school who made me recall the little boy that Your Character, Halle, punished so hard for being a ""fat kid"" eating a candy bar!]

Finally - I LIKE this host... but I admit that it grates on me when I hear someone pronounce the word ""JEW-LLERY"" - I am Instantly reminded of Long-Islanders hawking baubles on QVC...
The ROOT of the word is JEWEL [like the Singer from Alaska]...
And I laughed so hard when I heard the French phrase ""Trompe L'Oeil"" pronounced in a way that sounded - to Me - like ""Trump Lawyer""
[THANK YOU for Making me SMILE!]","@cuucnsbfl9913","0","2025-05-11","00:00:00","2025","2025"

2. To my eye, Jenner's outfit looked functionally the same as Kardashian's outfit but they got different reactions. How come?

"iWS3oVeyjL4","Romans 3:23 states: ""For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 ""But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death."". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: ""Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."". Romans 10:13 states ""For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."". 

   Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.","@johnpearson1258","0","2025-05-10","00:00:00","2025","2025"

"iWS3oVeyjL4","My two favourite looks were Teyana and Zendaya... opposite ends of the dandy spectrum, but both looking absolutely fabulous. But I also thought Lupita looked stunning... really, there were a LOT of amazing looks this year, and ones away from the usual. It's so great to see some more ""masculine"" styles... women's clothing has always been influenced by men's designs (like some of the historical military uniforms, through to suit jackets/blazers etc), it's great to see the ladies rocking the traditionally masculine suit, but looking gorgeous and feminine (there's just something about a well fitting suit; everyone looks sexy in one!).... and I love seeing the men looking so dapper. I find that a lot of men's red carpet looks (even previous MET Gala ones) are often on the dull/boring side; this year they're looking stylish and accessorised, and I am ALL for it!!

I know very little about the history of Black fashion (apart from the fact that it's always been more exciting and ""out there"" than standard white people's fashion) - I'm glad to have learned a little about it in this video (and will now do a deep dive into it), and think it was a great choice for the MET Gala this year!

"iWS3oVeyjL4","he has really good idea about fashion and lets us know what all those embellishments come from (fro the back culture) good piece of research. well done.

I'm a fashion dud but I liked

- Lewis hamilton - he kind of used all the elements and the overall getup was cool
- Lana del rey - she looked stunning with the colour choice the lace and the embellishment - but ofcourse not enough black dandy
- Kendall looked gorgeous - not enough black dandy (one u make it black dandy it starts looking gaudy)

Ifs

- Lupita - the suit and cape is great but not with that colour (a white or black or olive wd have killed it. mint green is for evening gowns and not on theme at all)
- Gigi (thanks for the input about where it came from) but somehow it is overthinking. To a casual onlooker it doesn't look anything great. Too much gold - it is even gaudy but not black dandy and not too pretty either.
- Zendaya - is wearing a plain white suit - not much to write about
- Shakira - a pink mess
- Teyana taylor is on theme but one look and u don't wannna look at that again.

"iWS3oVeyjL4","I must say, as a historian of African-American studies, and someone who I think people would consider a Black dandy myself: I personally don‚Äôt think of the women‚Äôs evening wear as not reflectively of modern and even historic Black dandyism. I definitely understand the historical origins of the term, but more modern iterations of high brow styling amongst Black folks, I would definitely consider a lot of showgirl outfits and evening gowns to be included in Black dandyism specifically. Gigi‚Äôs look, and definitely Megan Thee Stallion‚Äôs look (which I hope is in the next video) while maybe not dandyism in general (since it‚Äôs not a suit) definitely reads to me as Black dandyism to me from a cultural lens. The opulence, the decadence, the focus on flexing on someone through your fashion is a large part of what dandy  means in a Black context. I saw people making similar comments about Diana Ross‚Äòs look, and to me that was crazy. Diana Ross is 1,000,000% Black dandy whether she‚Äôs in a suit or an evening gown, because she‚Äôs dedicated to the art of asserting herself and dominating through her clothing.  The need to flex on, to stunt on, effectively to assert dominance over others through your dress, it is a large part of the spirit of the culture. Just food for thought ‚ú®.","@osimiri7111","0","2025-05-09","00:00:00","2025","2025"

"iWS3oVeyjL4","I find the commentator‚Äôs approach troubling. When discussing white American history in relation to Dandy, he stares directly into the camera, projecting confidence and authority, as if his perspective is definitive. In contrast, when addressing Black Dandy culture, he averts his gaze, looking downward, which feels dismissive or even cowardly, as though he‚Äôs uncomfortable or unwilling to engage fully with this part of the narrative. This stark difference in body language suggests a bias that undermines the discussion and perpetuates negative cultural stereotypes. Amateur commentating at best and to make such comments dressed as he is, simply dreadful.","@cigolicious","0","2025-05-09","00:00:00","2025","2025"

Diljit didn‚Äôt just show up in a great outfit he showed up in something deeply rooted in his own cultural heritage while honoring the essence of the theme. His look blended traditional South Asian elements with contemporary tailoring in such a respectful, elegant, and fashion-forward way. It was personal, powerful, and so well thought out.

(i know it goes beyond that, dont take me wrong, but u know what i mean) the people that usually delivers, delivers, the rest were meh at best. there was no imagination. pretty lame execution of the theme. ive seen more ""dandyism"" at regular church on a sunday.

every person (PLUS DESIGNER; THIS IS IMPORTANT) should get a ban from next year event if theyre ass at the one they attend. get them on their toes. let it be the hunger games. im tired of these lame ass ""celebrities"" (both people and designers) being lame af and just being there cause of who they are. imagine people that u dont know ROCKING the themes. the event would be BANANAS.

"iWS3oVeyjL4","One of the reason i trust VERY FEW people to talk about the met and the looks and you're one of the ones i trust (actually you're the only one i watch full length videos of) is because you DO THE WORK. You don't just sit there and say ""i like it, this it looks good and i dont like this look it looks bad"". You critic the clothes, research and explain their story, reference points etc. You give context to the garment and what the theme is and how it relate to the exhibition and why some outfits work and why some just don't regarldess of if their ""beautiful"" and ""good looking"" or not. You often look at more than just the ""acceptable aesthetis"".

I feel like a lot of people who ""critic"" the MET just like clothes and dressing well. But you on the other hand actually like fashion which are two very different things i think. Your videos are always informative.

And i did do some research before whatching the met. And i found myself so disappointed by people interpretation of the theme ""tailored for you"". And even ""critics"" definitly didn't take the context of it into consideration, or only when they wanted too and their opinion and threshold really depended on whether they liked the person or not. 

My exemple of that is for the women: some women came in BEAUTIFUL gowns. Seriously beautiful and they looked exquisite. And some referenced black women, but it still wasn't on theme (in my opinion). Like gigi hadid but there were black women that did it too. And to me (being black myself) being black and looking beautiful in a gown just doesn't do it even if you're paying hommage to another black woman you know...

People conveniently ignore that the theme is always in relation to the exhibit. They arent completely separate entities. 

And keeping the context in mind is something you always do when reviewing red carpets in general which is something i absolutely love about you and about this channel.

And on top of that you're funny and witty which just makes whatching your videos an absolute delight. I never put your videos as background noise but actually watch them until the end. 

But it also makes me so much more judgmental of other ""fashion"" critics and i roll my eyes at them so much because... why arent they as informed as you üòÇ

You porbably won't read this but i hope you know your work is valuable and so beautiful to see, everytime. And even when i don't agree with you i always love to listen to your thought","@Angel.p242","0","2025-05-08","00:00:00","2025","2025"

The theme was ""Superfine: Tailoring Black Style"", the whole point and emphasis was on suiting and history of black dandyism. Not a super generic ""Divas from the Early 20th Century"". And like you said Josephine Baker WORE TAILORED SUIT OUTFITS BY THE SAME DESIGNER, like if they wanted to reference her why not pick the looks that ACTUALLY matches the theme instead of a dress that had nothing to do with it.

"Ar9NFhmSnrk","Re the corset style with the baby bump...for many people, it's actually it's the opposite or wanting it to breath. You want some support. Best maternity pants I had were all stretch corduroy with a very pliable not tight elastic band that was a good three inches wide. It supports that weight that your body isn't built to support. I think Rihanna's look was stunning. I love that she's made being pregnant cool and fashionable. Some of her most memorable looks. Also love the bustle element which fit with the style of hat. Like there was a specific period referenced. Also really loved the skirt that showed off how pregnant her legs are! One of the worst body dymorphia things that happens is that public facing pregnancies are always like perfectly thin, petite woman with a massive bump. Most folks don't get pregnant that way...it's all over!","@cinemaocd1752","0","2025-05-14","02:00:00","2025","2025"
"Ar9NFhmSnrk","Just a comment on the constricted belly piece that Rihanna wore - it us actually quite relieving to wear something that helps you hold up the belly, as long as the pressure is even all around and of course isn't to much. I don't know if this is why she wore it, but putting a big shawl around your belly and tying it in the back can be an amazing feeling, especially as the belly gets bigger.

They wouldn‚Äôt necessarily have participated in the pageantry of it all as ‚Äúoutside observers‚Äù but they certainly would‚Äôve come dressed to kill in their own way. While I understand that the Met Gal theme is a chance for everyone to participate in the theme and make reference to the historical context of it, in a way, I think these ladies have done just that.

"Ar9NFhmSnrk","Regarding putting a ""corset  look"" over a baby bulb, the bones can be shaped.  Furthermore, we didn't see the back, but if it is laced, that would also allow her to adjust the corset to fit smoothly, but not too tight.  Finally, I was a dance costumer for years, and ballet costumers often create gussets out of Lycra that are dyed or painted to match the fabric of a bodice.  Those gussets are sewn beneath side seams.  Then the stitching of the original seam is carefully removed.  This allows the bodice to appear fitted, while still allowing the dancer the ability to move and breathe easily--the gusset allows the bodice to expand while still maintaining the look.  I am sure the couturier did everything they could think of to make Rhianna as comfortable as possible. My understanding is that the stars get to work with the designers to develop the look, and Rhianna is such a huge star, I am sure there is a ton of competition to dress her.  So the last thing the designer would want is for her to be uncomfortable in their clothes.","@almclester","0","2025-05-10","00:00:00","2025","2025"

"Ar9NFhmSnrk","Lets discus this over dramatic ""Luke"" clothing choice while he is giving his thoughts or those he was given by the critiques. The beige (blandest color on the planet, beige screams I have no actual thoughts of my own , just what corporate dictates color). The beige suit jacket looks like a trench coat and the outer smoking jacking looks like he borrowed his grandfather's robe. The tie is too large making him look like a little boy playing dress up in his father's clothes. If you want to use the annoying speech of other's who think talking like a Chadwick straight off the yacht, please dress as one. Ditch the oversized tie and trench coat, keep grandpa's smoking jacket, add a watch and a broach. You raided the men's wardrobes in your family, look into Grandma's jewelry box. Tie that smoking jacket up as a gentleman with style would and put a contrasting pocket square in the breast pocket.

"Ar9NFhmSnrk","You're trying to justify Pharrell and he went looking very bland. For example, ASAP was another co-host and he went with a simple look, but very, very polished. I also don't think Pharrell should be in any CD place like LV. What he said to Sabrina about her being short so he wouldn't put her in trousers was so wrong and shows he does not know much about clothing. The CD of any brand should know how to dress short people and should definitely know that creating cuts on the body is going to shorten the person, the long trousers elongate.","@aylennarbaes","0","2025-05-10","00:00:00","2025","2025"

"Ar9NFhmSnrk","Romans 3:23 states: ""For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 ""But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death."". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: ""Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."". Romans 10:13 states ""For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."". 

   Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.","@johnpearson1258","0","2025-05-10","00:00:00","2025","2025"

"Ar9NFhmSnrk","My problem with all the ladies wearing Louis Vuitton and style by Pharell were all the same...go half dressed ü©± Sabrina mention that Pharell said: she will not wear pants because she is short...so it wasn't her choice or her part to put on, her signature were the shoes. I don't understand why he decided to sexualize the looks on them and on the gents, make them look classic and more on theme. Maybe he doesn't know how to dress women. In general, I don't like his take on LV, but he is there to sell, I guess....
Sydney Sweeny was on theme, same as Zendaya they were honoring someone, but unfortunately, the tailoring execution on Sydney dress wasn't the best, similar to Gigi that maybe they played to safe and look as something was missing, but it's all because the style make them dresses look more normal than a memorable piece.

Teyana Taylor (her Whiskey Cane and Durag) and Cardi B's looks were Harlem-inspired. Zoe's bow was extra with intention. And while I also wanted to see more women in suits, especially Kim and Kylie. I do think some of the dresses and glam fit the theme. 

Dandyism was more about a philosophy and way of life than it was clothing. It's about embracing a unique and expressive style, often defying societal norms. Some women who identified as dandies did wear dresses. They were carefully groomed. Black men used formal attire to project an image of respectability and professionalism. They used tailoring, perfect grooming, and elegance as self-mastery. So I would say that Kylie, Sydney, Gigi and Nicole Kidman were very definitely on theme with their looks.","@alexm2244","0","2025-05-09","00:00:00","2025","2025"

WHY SO MANY TRAINS by women on the carpet. It's one thing to take the suit tails to extremes but the Train feels like an excuse for a frock that says nothing. 
After Diana Ross, everyone, aka white women, should have left their trains at the entrance. Capes yes, trains, no more, please. 
Re the Gigi Hadid, Gabrielle Karelfa Johnson wrote an interesting essay on substack about the invisible black women. I think the gold dress was a postscript to that essay. I'm not providing an opinion, simply context. If you want to read a met day in the life of a stylist - head to the substack by Gabrielle (it's called 'Brain Matter':  -aspiring stylists take note -  this day is crazy.

Also it is so innate and personal that to just go on another's critique is going to be tough.  For non-blacks he had to go with the theme specifically tailoring because they would have to have it interpreted, for blacks however that is not the case.  At least not from Luke.  I on the other hand was brutal in my personal review because like I said regardless of where in the diaspora you are from, as Black people we all know someone that showed up and showed out so no references or interpretation should b=have been necessary.  I can go into my closet and take out my great uncle's deep chocolate Halston jacket from the 60's, pair it with my mum's ivory striped flounced shirt and cream jodphurs and my high brown boots with hat and a cravat and be set.

Historically, some women had pregnancy corsets that did the same thing - lifting the weight of the belly so there wasnt as much strain on the lower back (all fully adjustable with lacing, to accomodate the baby's growth).

Sure half the dress is made out of suiting fabrics, but the dress is held together by the corset and then the skirt is draped. Even the little peplum collar thing is a rolled collar.

"Ar9NFhmSnrk","My main issue with the carpet this year is WHY IS THERE SO MUCH BLACK. The theme was Black Dandyism! Where are the colors?! the bold patterns?! The vibrant hues?! I'm not saying you can't do black in Dandyism successfully, especially if you using other elements of the stle like pops of color and/or pattern, custom tailoring, playing with fabrics, etc. For example Rihanna's look. I love that each piece  outfit, the jacket, skirt and bodysuit are all similar yet unique.The crop of the jacket, the pinstripe pattern and the bustle of the skirt, the use of grey and that overlaying striped pattern in the body suit. And then the contrast of the wool, the black and the stripes to the silk polka dotted pops of color in the cravat and pocket square? and then the oversized hat and the ankle shoe? Absoutely perfection perfectly in line with both the theme and with Rihanna's style. I'm getting off topic, I could talk about her look for hours.
I think you can really see what I'm talking about in Thom Browne's looks. Do not get me wrong, they're all absoutely gorgeous and extremely successful in their execution. You can tell he truly understood the theme and worked with each client to make it not only on theme, but on brand for them (which is important because a lot of Black Dandyism is the customization and self expression of the look) but he stayed in a black and white color palatte. By far his best outfit of the night was Janelle Monae, and I think a BIG part of that was the useage of red. It immediately drew your eye. I wanted more of that. A big part of Black Dandyism is the influence it draws from African and Cariabbean textiles and flair,and I feel like that influence was missing a lot of the time. 
The whole point of Dandyism, ESPECIALLY Black Dandyism is to stand out, assert originality, subvert social norms. Half of these looks blend right into the background or don't stand out from what you'd see on a typical red carpet (*cough cough* Sydney Sweeny, Hailey Biber, Heidi Klum). I'm not an expert in anyway shape or form, who am I to sit here and critque Thom Browne while I type this in a parody Star Wars t-shirt that says Cat Wars, but I just wanted to see more bold colors on the carpet this year","@an-ADHD-Infested-Nerd","0","2025-05-09","00:00:00","2025","2025"

It's also all dead stock which is masterful to make such sharp tailoring with that. The designer also mentioned being tapped at the very last minute and I'm glad Kendall is going for something not too standoutish.

"Ar9NFhmSnrk","oh god, the corset cult has arrived. It's like you just type the word and they're summoned, insisting they are the greatest invention to ever be invented and anyone telling you otherwise is part of Big Bra. Y'all have been tightlacing your brains I think, because this is bordering on TradWife nonsense. There is a reason just about no indigenous nation, especially matriarchal ones, feature corsets (I'm sure this will inspire someone to go searching for the exception to the rule), a significant amount of cultures never had anything resembling a corset and their women didn't just explode and d*e, and modern medicine doesn't recommend them - especially when you're pregnant, ffs. And it's not like modern medicine hates back support or something - back braces are recommended in certain circumstances, but hey, those aren't as appealing to pro-corset folks because they don't cinch your waist and the whole point is pretending it's not about vanity and getting a snatched waist. Not even getting into the boob support propaganda, because not all ladies are carrying heavy loads but corsets were something you used to have to wear regardless. Also, bras often being bad, doesn't make corsets or stays good - this is often how it's argued and it's so obviously fallacious that I'm shocked by how often I still see it.

Anyway, that was rambley but idec, because the corset-crew just have this crazy emotional attachment to this weird vestige of patriarchy and nothing I or anyone else says would ever convince them. You'll just get anecdotal nonsense like ""Um I wear corsets, and it TOTALLY feels TOTALLY comfortable ALL the time! And the support is the only reason I do it, definitely NOT because it gives me more of an hourglass shape!"" Meanwhile, even yoga pants feel good to get off at the end of a long day, nevermind an item of clothing with f*cking boning in it. And again, why does your ""it's for back (or boob) support"" ever require in any way a smaller waist, exactly? And how could it even support anything if it isn't constricting at all?? But my favourite defense I ever saw was ""Okay, so corsets leave indents on your skin, sure.... But you know what else does? The sheets you sleep on!!! Totally analogous!!! CHECKMATE FEMINISTS""

"Ar9NFhmSnrk","‚Äã@leapintothewildSpanx style shapewear isn't nearly as supportive as a genuine pair of stays/a corset simply because of the stretch - with well made stays, you can distribute the pressure and weight of your bosom or belly any way you feel comfortable without ever really needing to feel squeezed at all. Meanwhile, all the support of stretch shapewear comes from it being tight and you can't even choose where and how tight so if your boobs hurt on that day - tough luck.  They are completely different garments and I wouldn't recommend wearing non-medical non-custom compressive shapewear to any woman, much less a pregnant one - it doesn't provide any genuine shaping unless it's extremely, unhealthy levels of tight anyway. And for a price  medical girdle you can buy a custom made, for your unique shape pair of stays /a corset depending on preference, from a natural fabric, that'll last you a decade (and easily follow changing shape of the body) and just get more and more comfortable with passing time. For better endowed ladies corsets blow bras out of the water comfort level wise, allowing for comfortable distribution of the weight - but it has to be structured, fitted or tailored to your body shape garment. A stretch garment unfortunately gives only the illusion of that support and fraction of the shape, too.","@MargoTheNerd","0","2025-05-14","02:00:00","2025","2025"

"P71sr0kZY7o","Stylish people... PLEASE get the ""to be honest"" and ""honestly..."" out of your sad vocabularies. It's an awful trend. There are terms that specifically address moments when you're not holding back your thoughts out of politeness or civility. There are ways to communicate that you're not putting a pretty gauze on your message. Try ""to be candid"". Even ""frankly..."" sounds better than saying a tired phrase like ""to be honest"". The point is that we would like to think that people are generally being sincere and honest when communicating, with the understood subtext that some settings require tact rather than complete honesty. Declaring that you're going to 'say it anyway' (even if it offends or shocks) is different than saying you're going to be honest about what you think.","@K10House","0","2024-12-15","00:00:00","2024","2024"

I also thought about Nathanial Hawthorne's short story ""Rappaccini‚Äôs Daughter,"" about a scientist whose experimented on his daughter with poisonous plants, leaving her immune to poison but poisonous to everyone around her. He's the same person who wrote ""The Scarlet Letter."" It's one of those ""I hated reading it, but it still impacted me"" kinds of stories. 

I liked both of Zendaya's looks (the first one felt peacock-like to me), but I wasn't gooped and gagged like I thought I'd be. It's hard when she constistently sets the standard so high.

"P71sr0kZY7o","I'm honestly amazed Kim Kardashian had the nerve to attend a Met Gala tnemed around fashion from the past & the way fabric ages etc. (with an exhibition that festured dresses displayed flat due to their delicacy!) after what she did to Marilyn Monroe's gown!
Which ofc she totally didn't need to do because she had a replica made which she wore the whole night save for her arrival.

That dress was tailor made to fit Marilyn like a glove for the express purpose that no one else eould be able to wear it after!

Yes, she's worn corsets this way before, but this time she went overboard. Anyone who knows anything about corsets can see that her corset was not tightened correctly. This resulted in warping around the tightest section. A corset which has been tightened correctly will not have warping. There should be an even space between the edges from top to bottom, whereas Kim's corset was practically overlapping at the top. The corset edges shouldn't touch, but have a small space between them ( from 1 - 3 inches) , even when tight-lacing.  (Sorry to go on about it, but it really frustrates me when corsets are worn incorrectly).
I thought Chloe Sevigny's dress was amazing! It was a great representation of this year's theme, as was Tyla's dress. ( I really loved her hourglass handbag )üòç
However, Kylie Jenner. What can I say? It was a boring, ill-fitting, wrinkled, 1990's strapless prom dress!  I did NOT scream ""Met Gala 2024"", nor was it ""high fashion"". It was just......... bleh!üòí I also agree with what was said about Dua Lipa. Why bother showing up at the Met Gala, if you're not even going to try? And, I'm sorry, but the designer should be embarrassed of that - that - that - What exactly was that? A dress? A sarong and corset? Well, whatever that was! ü§îüôÑ
Thanks for giving your honest opinion on this year's Met Gala.

Honestly would have loved to see a look of ‚Äòthe garden retakes everything over time‚Äô kind of vibe like a garden unkept devouring a statue that was once in the middle of it. Sort of vibe.

It's also rumored Kim K's pilled cardigan was a late addition, due to her tightlacing the corset beyond where it was supposed to be worn, and the top of it no longer fitting the way it was supposed to. The ill-fit of the corset is more visible from rear-views of the outfit, and especially when compared to the test fit.","@orfordewerson","0","2024-06-15","00:00:00","2024","2024"

"P71sr0kZY7o","i believe i heard Ariana Grande share that they chose pearl as it takes literal years for an oyster to develop a natural pearl and it was a nod to the time it takes to create beauty.  it looked boring to me but that is just my opinion.  Mother of pearl is literally the breeding ground for a natural pearl.  i was very disappointed in general with all the fashion shown ‚Äî for the most part.  Where is the bananas creativity that fashion once was?  They had every option to get wild and create a masterpiece. Also, don‚Äôt come at me because I‚Äôm a creative individual and much like Christmas, everyone knows when the Met ball is coming. I‚Äôve created stuff for halloween that was more inventive. do I say that to brag? No I say that because they have all the resources at their disposal and just don‚Äôt take it seriously ..They have absolutel years to plan for this stuff.

*for reference* Mother of pearl, also known as nacre, is an organic gemstone that comes from the inside of the shells of mollusks like oysters, mussels, abalone, and snails. The mollusks secrete layers of aragonite and conchiolin, which create nacre, which protects the mollusk from irritants and encases pearls. Nacre is the main component of pearls, and mother of pearl is the thin membrane of shells that pearls are born from..","@not.taking.your.garbage","0","2024-06-15","00:00:00","2024","2024"

"P71sr0kZY7o","I think because you are so fashion knowledgeable, some of the looks you didn't like was because you missed the point. Yes JLo is always half naked. But her dress looked like spider webs that eminated from her vajayjay. She was an old spider that still has the ability to ensnare. The wooden corset one reminded me of an Egyptian goddess unearthed before brown withering of skin, but red lichen has started to grow on her. The sarong skirt screams Egyptian. Zendaya first look was spectacular, she was literally ""the blacker the berry the sweeter the juice"". She was a princess in a shady grotto, vines, and birds, with wise eyes, veiled from the harshness of the sun (exact opposite of her role in Dune). But you're right about her 2nd look. The hat was very early 1800's, so maybe she was supposed to be a just a head in a millinery shop window. Cardi B was a waste of material. Hemsworth could still stay studly, and wore something that aristocrats wore to garden parties, or the promanade like in Bridgerton. Or like Mads Mikkelsen in the series Hannibal. I liked the rose petal one but she should have done it like Anna, and wore a black sheath dress, or a pantsuit with verdant green shoes or brown. Lizzo I'm gonna go on a stretch here, maybe she was supposed to be a dead tulip, before the leaves fall off the stalk. All the others I say you are spot on.

"P71sr0kZY7o","Hair art has its roots in the 17th and 18th century, when high infant mortality rates meant that ‚Äúdeath was everywhere,‚Äù writes Karen Bachmann in an essay for the recent book Death: A Graveside Companion. ‚ÄúThe keeping and saving of hair for future use in jewelry or other commemorative craft (such as wreaths) was common.‚Äù But it wasn‚Äôt until the Victorian era that ‚Äúthe ‚Äòcult of the dead‚Äô became almost a mania in Britain.‚Äù

This was spurred by Queen Victoria herself, who ruled the British Empire from 1837 until her death in 1901. ‚ÄúIn 1861, her beloved husband, Prince Consort Albert, died, upon which the Queen entered into a state of formal mourning that lasted the rest of her life,‚Äù Joanna Ebenstein, founder of New York‚Äôs Morbid Anatomy Museum and editor of Death: A Graveside Companion, told Artsy. ‚ÄúThis encouraged a fashion for mourning in popular culture on both sides of the Atlantic that lingered until the turn of the 20th century.‚Äù (In the United States, the high death toll of the Civil War further fueled this trend.)","@NobleSteedAndFaith","0","2024-05-15","00:00:00","2024","2024"

"P71sr0kZY7o","I disagree about Zendaya. (I'm french, I apologie for potential language mistakes)
 
1- The first theme was Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion. On one side, you got the fairytaile where the princess woke up, on the other side, it's about preserved outfits so frigile, they can't be worn anymore. Plus, they had to use nature with insects and other animals. 

To respect this, stars can do it different ways : 
- They could wear very robust, colorful outfits that symbolize they're not dead/asleep anymore but awake and full of life. 
- They could also have crumpled outfits with dull colors that shows those outfits have spent a lot of time in a closet.
- They could wear something very frigile that can disappear anytime as the real sleeping beauties. 
 

For this theme, Zendaya wore a crumbled dress with dull colors and even with many animals on it. The dress was not amazing on purpose. She added a sassy attitude and showed this way how lively she was. The colors were dull but not the girl. 

2- The dress code was The Garden of Time. The short story of that book is : There was a couple that used magical flowers from their garden to stop time. They could keep their youth, their money and their life this way. They died after using all magical flowers from their garden. Therefore the subject is the inevitable passage of time that starts with life and ends with death.

To respect this, Zendaya had a bouquet hat on her head and wore a black dress. The bouquet full of colorful flowers, is a remind of the youth she still has. But in the same time, the bouquet itself is black as a reminder that those beautiful flowers will disappear one day. As a finishing, she also drapped herself inside a black dress cause she's also will disappear. She's litterally dressed as if she was going to her own upcoming funeral. Genious ! 

3- In this gala, most of the people didn't respect the theme or the dress code. Some slayed the The Garden of Time theme but not The awakening of the Sleeping Beauties. Zendaya respected not only the theme but the dress code and even the restrictions about the nature/animals. 
The only contestant who did better and can win the title for the best outfits that follow the rules is Tyla Balmain. Sand is fragile, it can changed with time, getting stronger or getting weaker. Sand is also part of nature. She even carried a bag curved as a hourglass full of sand. Perfect.","@neobahamut6751","0","2024-05-15","00:00:00","2024","2024"

"P71sr0kZY7o","Excellent review. I, too, agree that Chris Helmsworth‚Äôs look screamed of fragile masculinity (so on theme? lol), as in he couldn‚Äôt bear the idea of wearing something floral or outlandish to challenge his masc personality. It was insulting, really. A very, very blah met gala overall. Quite possibly the worst one yet.","@JayDelacroix-eh3rn","0","2024-05-15","00:00:00","2024","2024"
"P71sr0kZY7o","Stray kids shirts were heavily embroidered in floral patterns. Also all of the buttons and other metal accents were botanical/floral, and finally, the inside lining of their jackets was a floral print. 
So they were on theme technically. It's just that you had to be really close up to see it.
As for Stray Kids representing Tommy Hilfiger...I can't understand it at all! Their style is literally the antithesis of the preppy look. I know their company arranges this stuff, but it's just so weird.","@annekai","0","2024-05-15","00:00:00","2024","2024"

"P71sr0kZY7o","@HauteLeMode as someone who is not well versed in the history and art of fashion here is my thoughts‚Ä¶.
Bad Bunny was giving with his look 200 percent, he looked like Romeo coming to rescue Juliet or dead her but he was definitely giving with the exposed hems kinda like a beginning to an end. Chloe‚Äôs look was gorgeous, very in line with the theme, it reminded me of a dress from the Titanic but I could see it being a beautiful new version of a 21st century Cinderella dress. I wish there was some more details in the corset part of the dress though. Kylies dress was my favorite look, it was giving all the way for me it may not have been on theme but it was definitely a show stopper. Ben‚Äôs look was on theme all the way, my initial thoughts was Chanel but he was wearing a different designer. Balmain nailed it all the way with the look, UNDERSTOOD the assignment 100%.","@shaniquatennille","0","2024-05-15","00:00:00","2024","2024"

"P71sr0kZY7o","i think Sydney Sweneys dress would have been wonderful if they had leaned into the topic of petrolium in clothing. Nowadays polyester is used in so many pieces and i feel like the gloves represent that with their the plasticy (& oily) look.  The stems of the flowers mirror that plastic. What would have made the look complete, is if they had dunked the bottom of the dress in oily substance, or changed the colours of the bottom to dark brown/black to show that. That transition from light blue to those dark colours and the implements of oil looking/plastiky material throughout the dress would symbolise how fashion has been taken over by plastik (polyester).  With time  clothing has shifted from being entirely made out of wool or cotton to being made mostly out of polyester on a broad scale.  
Her dress would have beautifully symbolised that. & the dark hair would also fit to that theme since it isn't a sunshine and rainbows topic.","@inejklaus3047","0","2024-05-15","00:00:00","2024","2024"

Subscribing because it sounds like you know your stuff and i could learn from you about a subject I didnt think i was interested in.  Now I am.
When it comes to Gigi Hadid, I agree that the flowers look like an after thought. I was surpised that you didnt see the time element in it.  Based on your explanation of the theme I could clearly see one style gown (couldnt tell you what era) falling away and a new style emerging from it.

"P71sr0kZY7o","I'm a little disappointed that you didn't dive dipper into the outfits. For example apart from the dress Lana also had those hoove shoes/heels. Also, you should probably watch the getting ready video with stray kids, because their outfits might looks pretty plain and boring at the first look but there are a lot of floral details everywhere on their clothing. The overall look might have not given the wow effect, but they originally had coats (for the sake of a little reveal moment) on top of the suits, the coats had flower shaped buttons on them, and the flower embroidery all over the inner lining. Also, they had flowers all over those white shirts.","@kreyaSun","0","2024-05-15","00:00:00","2024","2024"

"P71sr0kZY7o","Fun fact about Chloe Sevigny's look: The braided flowers of hair and her actual hairstyle for the outfit I believe are referencing mourning hair. This is a Victorian tradition where people would create wreaths, jewelry, or other art forms by braiding and arranging the hair of the deceased. Flesh will rot away, but hair will stay through the tests of time. There were tons of floral motifs used in mourning hair. I'm no expert, but I assume it's linked to the Victorian obsession with flowers and their meanings - it was literally like a language they used, sending flowers as messages where each flower in a bouquet would hold a meaning, things like that.","@OhMJB","0","2024-05-15","00:00:00","2024","2024"

Considering those at met gala invited have oodles of money I agree Jennie's outfit is so questionable??? To say the least!!!unfit for such a supreme event. Why would u even wear that non meaningful blue thing ( and a mman to wear a baby blue suit ? 
Hi made a midnight conversion myself at midnight b4 the event...moonlight beaming on magnolia leaves and flowers wiltering, shooting stars, galaxy and meteors burning up some flora. 

√ås everyone in glamour America busy worrying about their interludes with that rapper lawsuit? Is that why they are looking so scared, plain &  boring? Are y'all been at his parties and trying to look straight? Jennie was a waste of photo money and space. Get a teacher to explain to designers what the theme it about met gala!!!

 Can I come instead nxt Yr? I vote absentee for Uma Thurman as Poison ivy...u do 2024 met gala low key and let the real creative ppl do their spectacular outfits instead of those poor worried rich n famous. 

Why isn't Lady Gaga participating ? Did she get caught up in Diddy's parties as well? Why havnt American police arrested him and put him in remand already???? So many famous ppl are guilty and involved...American police r losing respect worldwide for letting that pedophile blackmail so many famous ppl.  This met gala is so misunderstood for some reason? Thank goodness for blacktown medieval fayre...down to earth people making an attempt to be in theme, appreciating the flora and fauna, environmently friendly for families to participate and show nice costumes and be in character...

At your met gala, if women have to get men to lift them, re-arrange oversized trains etc...they need to go to group therapy for co-dependancy or counselling bc women don't need men to lift or fix them so they look like amazing women...women have so many medical conditions to deal with on their own that is what makes women different...please women at met gala...u r putting down the level of women ie jane fonda, julia gillard, angelina jolie, madonnna, that have fought to stand their ground and alone...why do u let male designers make u need men to lift you and rearrange ur dress for a photo??? U have to be able to walking alone without the bs trailing behind u , stuck to ur .... Look at all the simple mens' outfits  for a met gala, why do so many stars that pay a fortune for designers to be lacking in delivering spectacular clothing? A man in a baby bluee suit s not worthy of met gala. Where is Elton John or Rod Stewart, videos of freddy Mercury and Bowie?

You would need a ton of raw/deadstock denim, which I have no idea if Gap would have on hand since that‚Äôs not what they‚Äôre really known for. 

But idk, everyone that‚Äôs been on a raw denim journey knows how time is the only way to make those jeans perfect for you. Like. Never ever wash them, freeze them, sit in a bathtub with them on until they are for no one else but you.

Personally it feels like a view into how the ruling class will destroy everything beautiful in the world to hold onto their power and in the end become as cold as stone towards the rest of the people. This describes the whole Met Gala as it's all about the rich destroying everything beautiful in the world (excess air travel causing global warming, hoarding of wealth, throwaway products) to stay rich while being cold towards the rest of the people (poverty, lack of education, hunger, war). Their outfits are excessively expensive yet as cold as their hearts are.","@ambermay7032","0","2024-05-15","00:00:00","2024","2024"

"P71sr0kZY7o","The colors in the first Zendaya dress were necessary and spoke to garden colors that also evoke the end of the day. When something is at its bloom, it has no place else to go as far as it‚Äôs ripening. And we think about this with grapes and the blue green leaves of those vines. People into gardens, they get the blue green reference. That‚Äôs why I think it was necessary. Also, that vivid royal blue is evocative of sleeping beauty. I think the colors were supposed to also reference the ocean, but I don‚Äôt know the reason. She was portraying a character, and I believe that character was a villain, who represents some effects of the garden of time.

Her second dress is bet understood by context. Context being many things at once. The garden of time. the passing of time, this being a look of a widow, or perhaps somebody anticipating a death of some sort. The reference to Galliano in his past work, but also since Zendaya is an actress, she is portraying a second character here. in this way, she becomes an interactive exhibit because she is portraying the character real time as she enters. And for the fact that she wore it towards the end is also significant.  I think the dress plays into the theme by addressing its main point by the fact that both are not literal. What have we lost? Have we lost the sense of transcendent beauty?","@lyneae3786","0","2024-05-15","00:00:00","2024","2024"

The newer fabrics also often look costume-y, with some honerable exceptions like Kendal and Tyla. Lana's piece was wonderful but you can tell the lace is not something put together with human hands, whereas the original McQueen look had that precious lace .

"P71sr0kZY7o","Main issue is that you have a PHD college level understanding of the assigned Met Ball theme, others have a high school, others just an elementary school level, others never read the teacher‚Äôs instructions and should not return. 

you like some gowns that I hated. mostly because I can‚Äôt see what you see. So many black and black lace dresses ‚Ä¶ no matter what the theme‚Ä¶.. you can‚Äôt see anything if it‚Äôs a black rose on a black dress. And Vogue made such an issue of viewing it online or streaming. Gigi was all ‚Äúooh aah‚Äù cause all the details are clearly visible 

Am i the only one that hated all of Zedaya‚Äôs gowns?  She is always on the nose with themes, but she looked like a dark black gothic
 witch. 

All the Vogue hostesses wore gowns, not only ugly, but not on theme. If I was an alien, my guess that the  theme of the show was  ‚Äúbest, athletic fit, body or black outfits pushing boobs up to the ceiling.‚Äù  

Seems like Everyone wore Galliano gowns just cause it was the ‚Äúit‚Äù show last month. Some seem to wear the exact outfit from the Margela runway. Even one the models/actor from Galliano show served as  the Vogue hostess. I don‚Äôt remember that the Margela show had anything to do theme of the Met gala??   Kim Kardashian comes out grabbing a wrapped Galliano sweater around her boobs imitating the theatric runway show of Galliano.  it‚Äôs one thing to wear the theme of the show like Zendaya, successfully, did with a dunes and tennis theme.  Actors wear thematic clothes at press conferences, they don‚Äôt actually reenact scenes of the movie. ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.just super weird and not very original.

You can always look to her & Law to find the most interesting and thought provoking pieces and know Zendaya will look like a goddess in it.

"P71sr0kZY7o","I don't think you've reviewed Stray Kids' clothes enough. First of all, I must say that designing and matching the clothes of 8 different band members is much more difficult than designing clothes for a single person. And I think Tommy did a great job here, taking into account the members' personalities and characters and making it special for all of them. You said that the designed suits did not fit the theme of the gala, but you needed to do a little more in-depth research before criticizing. Even the buttons of the suit had a floral pattern, the inside of the suit and even the inside of the coats were patterned. You could see that it was designed to fit the theme, the clothes were definitely made up of very small and sweet details. This was their first premiere and they shined.","@darkcoldandverywindy","0","2024-05-15","00:00:00","2024","2024"

There might be someone else that understand the fashion thing in general and the Met Gala specifically, which I'm obviously not that can tell me things. I'd like to know how far in advance the theme of the gala is known by the fashion houses. In a way the costumes (might be dress, for all I know, so please just put the wrong wording down to I don't know what I'm talking about, which I really don't) have already been decided on and then, when the theme is presented it's glued on for the show. 
   I assume that the gala is a place where all fashion creators of renown (and perhaps those without renown, who would very much have some, please) would find as their best way to show their raison d'etre, outside their own, over the top, runway shows. I'm guessing there is a fair bit of planning and producing that they prefer to have done well ahead of time. so I can sort of understand if they want to go ahead with the bulk of their work. It doesn't give off the feeling of spontaneous brainstorming and late nights in their studios, to get their wow costume done by the seat of their as...ahem... beg your pardon there ... pants and skirts, for the gala every year.
   If this is the reason, then of course their couture would look boring, I guess. Is this reasoning correct on my part, and/or what am I missing? Yours, Ann","@annlidslot8212","0","2024-05-15","00:00:00","2024","2024"

"E_WcvAiKQfI","Luc,sweetie, you are wearing my favo shirt again, love it!!!

- Anna, LOVE IT!! Slick, heavenly, yep, loving it!!!
- Anne, loved the outfit, but the things on her boobies I like less!! But she is a hot looker!!
- Bad Bunny, THIS IS .................................... WAW WAW WAW!! We died, gone to heaven and their is angel Bad Bunny welcoming us!!
- Billie, you look great sweetie, sexy without being to much!! I wish you looked more happy yourselve. You are an amazing young woman, grab life by the balls!!!
- Cardi, I do like this dress!!! Sweet but with an edge! Sexy but also demure, perfect!!!
- Doja KittyKat, this is bonkers in a extremely good way! WAUWIE!!! WRRRRROOOOUUUUUUUUUUWWW!!!
- Dua: she looks vestal, clean, a Chanel Cinderella!!! VERY PRETTY!!
- Emma Ch.: maybe some pearls could have saved it??? She should have not wore that top underneath!! And placed a pearl waistband around het waist!!!! That would have been edgy do you not agree??
- Gigi is mi favo model!! She is a real looker!!! Even this outfit can not take that away. There are good things there but also bad things, it could have been so much better, misted chance, Matthew!
- Ice Spice: poor girl, she deserved much better!! The fit would have been better, like you say, Luc, and I do not like that high neck thing!! PITTY!
- Janelle herself looks surprised, gobsmacked!! You see her thinking: ""what is going on, get me out of here!?!? I feel uncomfortable!"". Very special, yeah but not a winner, sorry. Only that bag hihi. The outfit is wearing her instead of vice versa.
- Jared: what to say, FUN FUN FUN!!!
- Jenna: LOVE THIS OUTFIT!! She slays it!
- Jennie KIm: she looks like a doll, beautiful! But it better would have been a long dress! Perfect dress for a doll-like sweet looking girl. She looks shy to me, sweetie!
- Kendall and there we go again, the K-clan!! OMG HUGE SIGH!!!! Kendall: outfit = okay but not pur-fect ;-)
Kim = WHY all that nude always, we have seen that body already a zillion times and tired of it girl!! GET OVER IT!!! And listen to your daughter, North!! You always look so cheap whatever you wear!
Kylie = not Karl enough!!
-  Lil Nas, nice try, good looking cat here but not love it, sorry Lil!
- Lizzo, a pearl of a girl in a pearl of a dress! Looking good lady!!
- Margot, I would have add something, can not put my finger on it but it desperately needs a kick, an edge, a bit of a punch, it's to sweet now.
- Michaela: daring dazzling dress, well, nearly dress. But she can have it, she has the attitude for it!
- Nicole is wearing a cloudlet of a dress, flirty, coquettish, cloudy and amazingly stunning!!!!
- Asap: TOP-MALE-OUTFIT!!! Congrats!
- Riri: TO MUCH? SHE IS DROWNING!!! I would loved it if it had been a long cape!!! The dress is okay but not very special. What a pitty ................................................
Lots of missers, some toppers, and others that leaves us cold!!
Hope you all enjoy Luc his vids as much as I did, they are always fun, funky, to the point!! Love him!!
Lots of love to all loving people, Pinkie","@jozefbols4386","0","2024-05-15","00:00:00","2024","2023"

Decolletage is an art in itself and as far as I can tell Karl Lagerfeld was perfect in this regard. Anne Hathaway's dress was gorgeous but its one flaw was there. The idea is to make the breast of the woman look gorgeous, the breast and the breasts are not things to simply be covered. A perfect decolletage simultaneously produces mystery, desire and power.","@akosari2535","0","2023-05-15","00:00:00","2023","2023"

"E_WcvAiKQfI","I think it's a slap to The Met Gala and to the late designer Karl Lagerfeld. I know it's a fashion show. But this event had a theme to honor someone. The Met Gala is a prestigious event. What happened to being glamorous, classy, standing out with grace and beauty. Showing up in exquisite dresses and looking amazing. Are guys looking distinguished, charming and on point. You can do all that without showing up in a damn cat outfit like Jared Leto. They should throw you out if you show up it something like that. It's not an outfit. It's a costume. I like Lil Nas but he didn't show up in an outfit meaning suit or dress. Hell, I would have respected him more if he wore a dree and looked beautiful. I think shows should have some limits. I believe in creativity and having flare but not going overboard and not complying with the theme or even trying. I don't understand Doja Cat choosing her outfit but I can see sort of why she went that way. It's a mix between a gorgeous outfit and costume. But she clearly tried. Some of the people make me wonder if they on mirrors. These people are all gorgeous!!! They have the best designers, stylists, make-up artists, hairdressers and anyone else they need. I don't understand how NOT A SINGLE ONE PERSON SAID, HOLD UP A MINUTE! YOU MIGHT WANT TO CHANGE.

"E_WcvAiKQfI","Jared Leto's fur suit is one of the few interesting outfits that properly stood out and told me what Karl Lagerfeld as a human was like. Isn't that the point of an homage to a single person? You celebrate the person, be it as a professional or as a human being. The fact that a fur suit of the cat appeared here showed us just how much he loved the cat, and that's okay. Considering how lackluster and off-theme about half of the outfits look every single year, it is a joy to behold. The fur suit had more hours and love put into it than some of the dresses seen here.","@Strawation","0","2023-05-15","00:00:00","2023","2023"

"E_WcvAiKQfI","I thought Doja Cat was just so cool! From the prosthetic face to the long fluffy Couchette ""tail"" it was fun. Oh, God, Kim K. What to say.....she is just too short to wear many of the looks she thinks she can wear. She and Khloe have worn every sweater, every robe and every coat hanging off like that for years and it's stupid and boring. The skirt of the dress was just tragic, she just emphasized her short legs and looked very wide. I also wish she would wear a closed toe shoe. Because her feet are small and very squared off an open toe just makes her look like she has duck feet. Why can't these women get a decent stylist? Why can't they find styles/shapes that look good on them? Kim obviously spends a ton of money and is a beautiful woman but very seldom does she hit the mark. Jared Leto...my oh my....who came up with that idea? Movie my on, ASAP Rocky looked fantastic! üéØ, perfect homage to Karl.I agree that Anne Hathaway's dress was a great nod to Karl but I thought she looked very uncomfortable in it. It just isn't her style. At least , for the most part, attendees were on theme better this year than last year.","@charlottemccaig578","0","2023-05-15","00:00:00","2023","2023"

It's easy to just wear archive looks, but another designer doing a look evoking Karl but still being recognizeable as the designer who made it, that's a great look.","@jojoton4eva","0","2023-05-15","00:00:00","2023","2023"

"E_WcvAiKQfI","I think it's a slap to The Met Gala and to the late designer Karl Lagerfeld. I know it's a fashion show. But this event had a theme to honor someone. The Met Gala is a prestigious event. What happened to being glamorous, classy, standing out with grace and beauty. Showing up in exquisite dresses and looking amazing. In the past many men have looked distinguished, charming, handsome and on point. You can do all that without showing up in a Halloween costume or damn cat outfit like Jared Leto. They should throw him out if you show up it a costume. It's not Halloween. He's a great looking guy with an amazing body who looks stylish and handsome in a suit. I like Lil Nas but showed up in something you might see in a music video, maybe at New Year's Eve at a party or Halloween. Lil Nas has a fantastic body and he enjoys showing it off. He's a sexy man with an amazing body who could have gone elegant, stylish and found a way to show his body. He could have worn a dress and I would have respected him more. He probably would have looked fabulous.  I think shows like this should set some limits as to what you can and can't wear. I believe in creativity, imagination, being different and having flare. I believe in wanting to stand out. I just don't understand going way overboard and not complying with the theme of the event to honor the Karl. I know how much Karl loved & adored his cat. I don't think he would approve of Jared attire unless it was a costume party.  I've heard from many other fashion designers who worked with Karl, his friends and those that knew him really well, have said, that Karl would have disapproved of Jared look for the Met that night. Karl adored his cat but the Met Gala isn't the place to wear a costume. It's wear you display your style and art. 
 I don't understand Doja Cat outfit but I can see that she was trying to honor Karl in a respectful way. It's was a  mix between a incredible stunning gorgeous dress & a little bit costume. She clearly tried to make an effort. Some of the people at the Gala made me wonder if there were any mirrors around. These people are all gorgeous!!! They have the best designers, stylists, make-up artists, hairdressers and anyone else they need. I don't understand how NOT A SINGLE ONE PERSON SAID, HOLD UP A MINUTE! YOU MIGHT WANT TO CHANGE. Honey, I love you but if you go outside wearing that someone going to think you're insane for sure.","@sierra7202","0","2023-05-15","00:00:00","2023","2023"

In many ways Jared Leto look was more playful and cute. She should have dropped the act to answer the questions. The whole event was off the wall. Fashion has changed so much over the years. It's not about style, creativity, imagination, distinguished, or standing out and wowing by looking stunning or drop death gorgeous. I wasn't actually trying to troll. The more I thought about it. I actually just agreed with you. There were other outfits I thought were worse than Jared. He was at least trying to be cute and playful. I might go back and edit my statement from before when I get a chance. Thank you for your comment.","@sierra7202","0","2023-05-15","00:00:00","2023","2023"

"E_WcvAiKQfI","¬†@espeon871¬† I understand that. But from everything I've heard, he knew the designer very well.

"E_WcvAiKQfI","¬†@memento81¬† I agree. I told someone else. If they really wanted to honor Karl,  they could have had a Custom Pin, Ear Rings, Brooch or Broach, Watch, Necklace or Tie. There are 100 of ways to pay tribute and honor someone with style, creativity, imagination and be  dignified.","@sierra7202","0","2023-05-15","00:00:00","2023","2023"
"E_WcvAiKQfI","¬†@TeaLinnea¬† I wasn't trying to say Jared Leto cat outfit was the worse. He came off kind of cute. He wore a suit under it, I've been told. I'm just saying he could have done more with his suit than just throw on a cat outfit on the outside of it. 
   There are many ways to pay tribute & honor  someone you adore or respect depending on who the person was. You can go in so many directions. I don't know a huge amounts about Karl Lagerfeld. Except he was a well liked a respected designer who many adored and aspired to be. 
There are so many ways to pay tribute or honor someone. Especially, if you know them really well. I don't know if Karl had a sense of humor & enjoyed off the wall costumes, mascot outfits or cat outfit. We do know he adored his cat from the way everyone speaks of him. But would the fantastic mind of a creator really show up or want anyone showing up in a cat outfit no matter how much it looked like his cat. I don't know. Somehow I don't think he would have thought it to be creatived enough to wear at the Met Gala. I can imagine a few ways that would been a better way to honor him. Someone could have gone with a one of a kind custom Brooch or Broach, a custom watch or a watch Karl loved. A Necklace, ear rings or cufflinks. Custom made Bolo Tie with a custom made ornamental bolo pendant with his cat on it. There's the silk ties that are worn with Brooch or Broach that are elegant & gorgeous. A could see a lady wearing a ladies necktie that has two ties and decorated with beautiful broaches. They are handmade and gorgeous. Handkerchief Men's Necktie and Lapel Pin Brooch would have been nice with a nice suit. A custom scarf with an elegant dress, suit, etc. I could even see a guy wearing shoes like Vans with Karl cat on them. I actually don't think the cat outfit were the worst. Some of the other people were much worse. 

By the way we are all allowed to give our opinions. I wasn't aggravated or upset by anything anyone wore or any comment made by anyone. It wasn't just my opinion though. I have watched over 40 reaction and comment videos on the Meta Gala and spoken with a number of people. Some people loved Jared costume and hate Dojo Cat's. The reactions were all over the place. I was saying with all the money, power and the ability to designers, hairdressers and others in the business, was this the best some could do?","@sierra7202","0","2023-05-15","00:00:00","2023","2023"

"E_WcvAiKQfI","Black people fawning over a Karl lagerfeld themed met gala reeks of Stockholm syndrome but for a carnival of narcissists desperate for attention... it's fitting. 

Despite the upper echelon anticipation,  there is no creativity ... at all.

Hence the ground hog day reintroduction of past theme after them after theme... or people simply not thinking outside of the box.

Their clothes are wearing them in most instances like NO ONE KNOWS WHO THEY ARE.  

Yet the most creative amongst us never can ascend to the ""club"".

Idol worship is where divine sparks go to die.

Sycophants abound.

I like this guys commentary because he isn't afraid to highlight and narrate the embedded bigotry, narcissism and racism in the industry without being ""woke"".

He always gives his perspective for an alternative pertaining to his critiques which denotes he has a keen eye and creativity.","@soulfacey14","0","2023-05-15","00:00:00","2023","2023"

The two presenters were awful, mispronouncing Vogue on purpose, mispronouncing the designer's name on purpose (to be funny i presume), Lala Anthony no matter what anyone said to her she said ""absolutely"", the design decor lighting and questions were all a 3/10. Lagerfeld was the epitome of europe, the carpet should have looked a lot better and he loved flowers - Anna knows how his runways use to look! 
They all looked half bored to be honest, no excitement about the event, nothing.

"E_WcvAiKQfI","THANK YOU. Jennie and Rose both looked bland PERIOD. I cant believe that the overhype is going until the Met Gala. Rose and Jennie had forgettable looks, Jennie at least looked decent but Rose showed up like she was going to a party and not to the freaking Met Gala, their fans ofc would NEVER EVER admit that they looked bad or too bland and would always hype them up. 
Also it's TRUE that blackpink literally have no personality other than their brand deals, the only thing they talk about in their songs and interviews is the respective houses they endorse. They are heavily manufactured with 0 personality, enough talent to impress this new generation that has vey low standards and too much media play. Their music alone would have NEVER got them where they are today if it wasnt for the Brand deals and becoming house ambassadors at around 3 years in the industry all at the same time. Also they really dont have that great of a fashion sense except maybe Jennie and even Jennie doesnt experiment with her style and only sticks to the LA Girl style. Before they became house Ambassadors Lisa and Rose probably had the worst fashion sense in the group and you can tell when they chose their own outfits during performances and the outfits get so much backlash by the fans even though the fans dont know that their girls picked their own outfits. We were made to think that they were super famous because their songs were good, we were made to think that their exceptional fashion style is what landed them a contract with the famous fashion houses, we were made to think that they were good perfromers, we were made to think that they have a good personality and are funny and all. It's all manipulation from the media and the fans should really stop coming for anyone that doesnt kiss Blackpink's ass because its getting tiring.","@beyivy691","0","2023-05-15","00:00:00","2023","2023"

They leave the fans waiting for 2 years and begging for new songs and then they drop the most horrendous songs known to humanity and watch their fans eat it up and stream it and like it ans buy it. The fans also play a part in Blackpink's mediocrity because of they actually called them out whenever they were lacking, the girls would be pressured to impress the fans and train to come up with something good but just watching Blinks defensive that horrible World Tour made me realise that these fans are just pathetic and Blackpink will never actually change or make an effort.","@beyivy691","0","2023-05-15","00:00:00","2023","2023"

The fact that they giy brand deals with the big fashion houses even though they have no influence in fashion and were barely that famous internationally was super fishy. Awards? They payed for it. Performing at Coachella? Payed for it. YouTube views and spotify streams? Payed for it too.

That doesn‚Äôt allow you to be this rude and of topic. And big brand investing in blackpink so what?

"E_WcvAiKQfI","I find this critique too negatively focused. It's either the looks are too simple when they are vintage or reproduction, or not deep enough beyond Chanel pearls, camellia or tweed. I disagree. I think this was one of the better Mets. I like when it feels true to the designer, true to the wearer and on theme. He was so influential that if someone got too nique/deep in an old reference it wouldn't read as referencing Karl, but referencing a decade. Based on your history of Karl video, the real strength/essence of his designs was about referencing others or the past but making it fresh while having a clean cut. To be too referential would to be going against that essence. I loved his kitsch 80's phase, maybe that's what all the cat looks were influenced by ü§£ Especially 1983 sequin draping. Didn't realise he did that. I was obsessed with the range Gucci did in 2016 that did that with ribbons and bows. Wish Alessandro was with a house to do more of those looks.","@NeeLi-qu1hn","0","2023-05-15","00:00:00","2023","2023"

Karl's aesthetic was very elegant and simple can't think of the words for it but very 'vintage and settled' feeling...which is also why I personally really liked Rihanna's ending 'Chanel Bride' dedication.  She stuck to all the little  things he was known for the handmade coat/shaw of the flower was enough drama needed for me.

What I was not glad to see was that dress Balmain stuffed her into. It looks terrible on her, doesn't fit properly and isn't at all in tune with what appears to be her generally more youthful style. I know she is a very curvy woman - a fit, petite, curvy, which likely won't do for a sample size and takes personal tailoring- but to cover her from neck to foot with long sleeves in that dreadfully stiff fabric?? She's a young woman. That is a dress for an older lady, in my opinion.

"E_WcvAiKQfI","I think this whole 2023 Met Gala has the running theme which is this year was just boring. Look now don‚Äôt get me wrong, many of the people who attended are my favorite celebrities like Jennie from Blackpink, Emma Chamberlain, Rhianna and others, but I just felt like the theme this year was just not as open as others in the past, where stylist could explore. Most just picked outfits from past collections without really adding much to it. Which in turn made it extremely boring.

 I personally feel like if the theme was more of a memorial to all the different fashion designers who have passed (which there is at least 10 others who passed recently) I think stylists could have had a bigger range to work with.","@Blinky423","0","2023-05-15","00:00:00","2023","2023"

Kendal brings the bare bottom to the Met Gala... Good Lord.
Kim Kardashian - tres simple, not elegante, anti caliente - but she did do an updo though. That's something.
Kylie looks really tired. Poor thing. What was she doing before arriving at the Met Gala.  I must say I like a more modest Kylie repping the Jenner/Kardashian troup.
Oh no. Lil Nas ty X. nNooooo.  Oh deary moi.
Lizzo looks very nice.  I support her. She is truly elegante and I look forward when she really blossoms. 
Margot did not get it. Sorry Margot - it was not tailored. It looked so ""Ready to Wear"".
Michaela Coel - FABULOUSSSSS!!!! I may just feel this way because everything else that came before was so blah. Why can't everything be approved by Anna prior to the Gala?  Would that be wrong??

"XUIB4oWw37I","I don't think Michelle Yeoh's outfit has anything to do with Sciaparelli - it looks more like they used the typical Lagerfeld black and white fabrics and the hint of a shirt-like cut to create the classic silhouette of traditional Chinese clothing. Because if you look at the outfit for a bit longer, that's what it does - the sleeves, the black and white down to the skirt, the skirt itself getting wider and covering the floor...","@xolitaire","0","2024-05-15","00:00:00","2024","2023"

Per se Karl ofc can't be hold responsible for his parents and closer family, however when picking up the work for Coco Chanel, a (even) by then known Nazi collaborateur, it left a bitter taste in a lot of peoples mouth over time that he a) was not honest with his family's provenence and sued on multiple occasions when journalists or historians brought it up and b) ignored/downplayed Chanel's role during WWII to a point where it (as I remember it) was impossible to even slightly criticize a seemingly ""inclusive"" and ""cosmopolitan"" Chanel and its history throughout the 90s and mid 2000s.

I think this is why Karl wouldn't have wanted this theme...which Anna did acknowledge but did it anyway. lol! I love the theme, just not many of the looks. The Christopher John Rogers look is actually inspired by Karl's work at Fendi, all of the construction that goes into couture pieces. Personally, I love that he is bascially celebrating the parts of garments that are never seen. Your interpretation of Russian constructivism is valid of course, I can see that as well in the dress but because soooo many focused on Karl's work at Chanel and his own personal style, I really appreciate seeing a very well done piece that was based on his work at Fendi.","@hopew6979","0","2023-05-15","00:00:00","2023","2023"

Fantastic. 

As always, the depth of knowledge you bring to your critique is incredible.  You take us along a fashion history journey and open a door for us to view these pieces with so much more understanding of what it is we are actually looking at.  So, even if I don‚Äôt personally like a piece, I have an appreciation for what was executed.  Or failed to execute as the case may be hahah.  When you don‚Äôt like a look, there is a reason based on something relevant, it‚Äôs not just snark.  Honestly, it‚Äôs not an overstatement to say that the designers would do well to watch your review of their work.  There‚Äôs valuable feedback here for them.

"XUIB4oWw37I","You captured how I felt about Olivia Rodrigo really well... like I was weirdly angry? whenever she appears in the worst possible outfits on the red carpet because she's beautiful. Literally a naturally pretty face, & a 'conventionally' ideal slender body...like what could go wrong?? But it does, every. single. time. Her Grammy dresses for both years were atrocious. The first was an ugly & badly-fitted/designed dress. The second was the most boring Black slip dress ever, very underwhelming, very dull, very rag. 
If she wants a more mature aesthetic, there's more ways than to be simply boring, have fun and not let minimalistic dullness wash her out. It works for some people, but somehow the minimalist style does not look good on her. This MET I was surprised because she's actually in an intriguing ensemble, many people despised it, but it's clearly an ode to Audrey who's moment with Chanel has such fashion & pop culture significance. I liked it, definitely not boring. Really hope she explores fashion more, be encouraged to have fun with it.","@MM-kz3tj","0","2023-05-15","00:00:00","2023","2023"

But her red carpet stylist could do a lot better is what I'm saying. In my original comment, I mentioned liking her MET ensemble this year. Just as Luke said, it's more intriguing than anything she's previously worn. She has some cool afterparty looks, which are better than both grammy dresses. The black grammy dress this year was, I apologise, just lacklustre and dull. But she has a lot of potential.

He was one to publicly and directly insult celebrities left right and centre in not so subtle ways. This was to people who were alive.. calling Adele fat and Pippa Middleton ugly, just to name a few.

Aside from him, It's very offensive to me that the first BLACK MALE model seen in a Chanel show is put in women's style clothing.  I have no idea why any black person would wave the banner of ""Chanel"" for anything.  I say this as a black person having married a white man and love being in diverse circles.  But at the beginning, middle, and end of day I'm still black.  I have a black brother and father.

"XUIB4oWw37I","I used to watch this channel every single day like 2 years ago, but then as I struggled to keep up with my finances in the face of a fashion industry that every day cared less and less about incentivizing designers with artistic merit but rather corporate-driven, over-commercialized designers, my interest in fashion, along with hopes of being able to truly afford the pieces I wanted fainted rather quickly. But after seeing some of the ridiculous Met Gala fits along with some great ones, I thought to myself ""I definitely wanna hear what Luke has to say about these!"" so now I'm back and both these Met Gala videos are reminding me exactly why I love fashion. It has nothing to do with whatever design agenda designers are trying to push or how much I may dislike it. It's about individualism and how clothes make us feel special. Even though I didn't love a lot of these looks, and even if they were off-theme, a lot of work and care were put into these looks and that's an artistry I'll always respect. Excited to start catching up more on fashion again. Thanks for the great videos, Luke + Team.","@timskully3496","0","2023-05-15","00:00:00","2023","2023"

We now know the fragile art piece gown was damaged by the aggressive attempt to get it on KK‚Äôs body, which failed because this dress was hand sewn while Ms Monroe wore it. This is why we see that abomination white fur to cover the fact it did not fit KK at all. The dress was returned torn with precious crystals missing  and more unspeakable damage was caused. Bob Mackie himself was opposed to this as were most of us.
KK looked awful and destroyed a precious piece of fashion iconic history.

"PbRZcvVnF0w","How you dig deep to compliment kourtney tells me everything about your style IQ, she did what she did as a fuck you not for the sake of the theme or fashion. The entire clan was there to basically cover the costs of the Marilyn stunt bs and obvious she didn‚Äôt wanna be there and has made this clear throughout their infamous history.

As for kim and kardashians, kim would have been dragged regardless but probably a lot less with a replica- just another using her for fame. So many still jealous and hateful of Marylin or creepy to her like hugh hefner.. Not to mention all the hassle going blonde for a boring af slickback. khloe and kendal shined, blake overal was my fave.That is the glam and big show we all wanna see. 
    Kourtney probably felt very punk and rebellious in the moment and that‚Äôs cool for anything but the met. I‚Äôve never seen something so awful minus the dumb sheer or avn dresses with a cheep nude thong under. It‚Äôs one thing to do this at some random event but not at an event all about fashion. I know this is old but I just saw the BTS footage behind the dress concept and design, it was an intentional fuck you mess.
    For whatever reason, they‚Äôre going on and on about being icons for fashion and it‚Äôs tired. No one is more of a try hard than them and kanye. While others, style comes to them naturally. 

Either way, call a spade a spade, it was dumb and dirty what she did. I think the event is a bit overwhelming high society crap but it‚Äôs also this giant beacon that the fashion world is forcibly centered on. With all that said, it‚Äôs still awful what she did and there are worse things happening in the world but man don‚Äôt pretend what she did was appropriate at all.","@Cc07","0","2024-08-15","00:00:00","2024","2022"

"PbRZcvVnF0w","Luc, you look smashing dear!
First of all: Kim K should be ashamed, she well never be as fab as Marilyn Monroe!! Do not like that family. Why?? Well, that entire family (including the kids) are completely unworldly!!! They feel so much better than the common people (the plebs), they are haughty, arrogant and know-it-alls!!! Plus: they think they own the world!
OOO, are they beautiful according to you?? Plastic fantastic yes, almost everything about them is fake!! If you were to take that away they would look like you and me, dear people = PLAIN!!
Sorry, they make me so mad with their behaviour. And no, I do not hate them, there is a huge difference between disliking and hating!!! REMEMBER THAT people!
- Alicia: I love the cape but not for this gala, so you are right, Luc! The dress is top, on its own.
- Anitta: the color of that dress, love that very much, the pearls are a bit to much, but hey, thats my opinion of course ;-)
- Love the feathers on that short cape of Anna, but not the fabric, nor the dress!
- Ashton is gonna give you a lift I think! But love the outfit cause it's so out of the box!
- Awkwafina: WTF??? What is going on with that outfit, it is beyond FUGLY, It seems to be composed of all kinds of fabrics and prints, in short, a huge miss match!!
- Bad Bunny is mad and going over the edge!!! What is going on with that outfit, he looks so stiff, poor guy.
- Bella's boobies are going on a rampage!!! Love the bustier, she looks a bit gothic on chique haha.
- I love Billie but this is not her best look and she knows it!! Billie, go your own way dear, do not listen to stylists!  You are a rebel, stay a rebel!!
- Blake is ALWAYS spot on!!! She is a beauty, she shines and whatever she wears is FAB!! Her husband gives her the spotlight, way to go, Ryan!!
- Camilla dear: this is a huge NO!!! In the video of her song 'Havana' she wears a short dress  (Charleston-look) and that looks smashing on her, she should wear daring sexy dresses, not these 'modern' type ones!!
- Golden Godess Cardi B, I like it, she looks fab!! Sorry Luc, do not agree here!
- Chloe: ........................................................................................................... NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO girl!!
- Emma, love that skirt but would have worn an other crop top (something silver).
- Emma Corrin looks indeed dandy hihi, top .... hat LOL. Nice and funny look!
- Evan wears something daring! Outfit not bad but that fabric is a big no go!
- Gigi, I love her very much, she is a stunner!!! But this outfit is draining her, such a pitty.
- Hailey: dress is okay but those panties: BLACK, really????
- Katy girl, never let somebody push you in a dress like that again dear!!
- Kendall: where is that skirt going?? It's not my cup of tea, sorry!
- The rest of the family: Khloe: lame, tries to imitate her sister, Kim!  Kim: shame on you girl!!! You can not tip on Marilyn, NEVER!! That dress is old, delicate and extreem vulnerable, and you, a nobody, wants to wear that dress, you should be very ashamed!!! She and her family have no respect at all for people or precious things!!!! Travis looks sharp and swag!! Kourtney: I do like the cropped shirt but not put together like this! The skirt however looks like she pulled it down so you can she a part of her spanx pants!!! Not a good look. Kylie: why do lots of them like to wear weddingdresses to a gala or event??? Looks like a child playing dress up. AWAY WITH THE KARDASHIANS!!! Sorry not sorry, can not help it, really do not like them at all, they are all so fake ;-(
- Lizzo, that coat is ' tres magnifique', the dress less but it's fun! She loves it and that is good to see, she has spunk!!
- Megan T.S., you are right, Luc, that 'mesh' is not the same color as her skintone and therefore ugly!! If the only used the gold fabric, would been so much better!
- Nicki: LOVE the look, but that top part, MY GOD!!!! Those bazookas are really trying to escape, desperately!!! Poor boobies, so 'cornered'. LMAO!
- Nicola: a big kodus, girl, this is THE look, looking good sweetie!!! Big thumbs up!
- Olivia: like Luc said: fire the stylist!! The hair is TOP!
- Rosalia: Way too messy that outfit üëéüèª
- Russell: you are taking it to the next level and it's f*cking FAB!! Respect!
- S.J.P: SATC at the MET-gala!! SLAY!!
- Shawn: what is there to say? He is burning it, so hot!!

It could've been done way better. I don't get how a lot of these couture designers are so famous. I wouldn't pay a dollar for a lot of their shiz. I LOVE Billie Eilish's outfit. Also I love Blake Lively's dress. Evon Mock, just doesn't look good on him. I would've done better with that outfit. Not a good look on him no mater what you say. Gigi Hadid puffer coat is just plain ugly af. Some of these women are just trying to be cute and don't care about the theme. Kim KarTRASHian doesn't do that dress any justice at fkn all. How disrespectful. Looked WAAAAAAAY better on the beautiful and awesome Marilyn Monroe. She should be in jail for that shiz. She didn't have an ass implant, but she does add her body fat to her but. I love you Kourtney. You can wear whatever you want. You and Kendall are awesome. Lizzo you can wear whatever you want girl. I freaking LOVE Meghan Thee Stalion's outfit.

"PbRZcvVnF0w","Very confusing situation with the whole Marilyn dress because Ripley's said it was returned undamaged...then suddenly its damaged?? Also she didn't ask to wear it, the idea was presented to her and Ripley's (the fame hungry establishment that it is vs an actual museum that respects history) was more than ecstatic to have her wear it! This was just a bad case of being mislead by a team of stylists who thought they were being ""iconic"" and trusting the wrong guidance...and above all a GROSS misuse of history by the very people who claim to protect/respect it... Ripleys already held very little respect as museum, this just made it lose so much more. This is why the historical related industry was so appalled. It has nothing to do with Kim but since people love to hate her it's all a bandwagon bashing from people who don't even truly care about history or Marilyn Monroe's heritage. The point is ...NO ONE should have ever worn it nor any other historically relevant garment/piece of any kind from any historical figure. Inspired by...sure! but literal garment/piece?

3) Lady Gaga I loved the royal Blue Dress with the Pearls all over the chest and she was on theme. Gorgeous.

Considering that the dress did not fit the year's theme and she was supposed to be immediately changing out of the dress and into a copy, for the evening, i didn't see the point in traumatizing the dress. Also had not understood why a Ripley's believe it or Not museum would spend so much to obtain the dress and let Kim possible destroy it. (unless it was an insurance thing) I feel that a Florida Ripley's tourist museum does represent, to me, the level of culture Kim K should be credited with.

Kim wearing Marilyn Monroe's dress is an atrocity and she climbed stairs in it stumbling all over hem. With her big fake butt. She should have had her butt removed if she wanted to wear a dress fitted for Marilyn but is just not in any way something she should have desecrated and left her DNA. The dress should be in the Smithsonian. Seems like many are all trying to wear Marilyn style? Did they know ahead about Kim wearing it?","@joymontague251","0","2022-05-15","00:00:00","2022","2022"

"PbRZcvVnF0w","¬†@daniellesene7574¬† Actually no one really knows how it disappeared. However, I‚Äôve read most historians believe that, during the partition of India and all the process of decolonization,the royal families experienced a huge economic recession. Hence, in an attempt to save themselves from bankruptcy, they sold many of their valuable belongings such as jewelry, which were easy to trade in the European market. That way they‚Äôd manage to make some money (plus if they didn‚Äôt, the Indian government would take all those pieces away). So most likely, the Maharaja of Patiala sold the necklace Cartier made for him and then claimed it was stolen. Then it probably went thorough many hands after ending up at an auction. Such an amazing story

All that being said, I completely agree that it‚Äôs horrible that such an important piece of Indian history is being worn by a white celebrity. It should definitely be turned back and preserved in a museum","@omaralejandrobouamraniarte9089","0","2023-05-15","00:00:00","2023","2022"

Emma is wearing a piece of jewellery (her necklace) that was more than likely stolen by British colonizers, Emma was wearing the Maharaja of Patiala Bhupinder Singh which was created by Cartier in 1928, it had the worlds seventh largest diamond implanted in it. 

People say it‚Äôs legend, but it‚Äôs not, this necklace was stolen. The necklace mysteriously disappeared after the Maharaja sons Yadavindra Singh wore it for the last time in 1948, it then reappeared years later in London, England.

"PbRZcvVnF0w","¬†@3kxi761¬† Very true and we both agree. I‚Äôm just saying they did make some attempt at preserving the dress. This is from a Vogue article:
¬´ The truth is Kardashian only actually wore the original dress for a matter of minutes. Given the fragile nature and historical value of the dress, she wasn‚Äôt about to take any chances. In fact, her whole process of getting dressed reads like a highly sophisticated military operation. First, she left her hotel in a dressing gown with barricades set up outside to obscure the view of any waiting paparazzi. She then arrived at a small fitting room by the Met Gala steps that was especially organized for the occasion. There a conservationist from Ripley‚Äôs was on hand to assist her in white gloves. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm extremely respectful to the dress and what it means to American history. I would never want to sit in it or eat in it or have any risk of any damage to it and I won‚Äôt be wearing the kind of body makeup I usually do,‚Äù says Kardashian, who changed into a replica of the dress also owned by Ripley‚Äôs once she successfully climbed the stairs. ‚ÄúEverything had to be specifically timed and I had to practice walking up the stairs.‚Äù ¬ª","@aishayu7065","0","2022-05-15","00:00:00","2022","2022"

"PbRZcvVnF0w","Hot take: in a backassward way, Kardashian wearing Marilyn Monroe's dress was perfectly on theme. The gilded age was beautiful, but all that opulence was really a tasteless display of sheer wealth by the nouveau riche in order to gain social clout, and all that wealth was built on the back of exploitation. A pathetic, attention seeking echo of past glamour, meant basically to flaunt power and riches? Sounds like the modern gilded age to me.","@artemisquill6542","0","2022-05-15","00:00:00","2022","2022"

"PbRZcvVnF0w","Seeing Kim not only wearing the dress, but trying to fit into it in the first place, made me sick. Marilyn's body was her own, and the dress was made to fit to Marilyn's natural female body. Kim's entire body is plastic and fillers, and no matter how much of her own flesh she decided to lose on a diet, the front and back implants would never fit the dress as it was meant to fit a normal human woman. She looked cheap, phony, and ridiculous, trying to look like something that she never could, and trying to impress people who probably weren't even alive during Marilyn's life, nor know the significance or back-story of the dress, anyway, so what was her point, except the usual ""look at me, look at me"". For her to be allowed the opportunity to destroy the dress, and I believe it was destroyed, as seen in the video of multiple people yanking and trying to pull it up over her full-body girdle, made me throw up in my mouth. I was waiting to see the fragile fabric rip in the hands of the people who were forcing it up over Kim's unnatural shape. Also, Marilyn had to be sewn into the dress, so how is this one being held together - safety pins?!  Do you know what a safety pin would do to the sheer, delicate, and fragile fabric?  In the world of museums and national artifacts, I believe that a professional's opinion should be called for to describe the irreparable damage that's been done to the dress, including Kim's body oil, body makeup, perspiration, and skin cells that have permeated the fabric.  Ripley's should also be forced to publicly describe this damage to the world, and give a reason for it. Obviously money doesn't buy brains or class.  Allegedly!","@marciasagadore2158","0","2022-05-15","00:00:00","2022","2022"

"PbRZcvVnF0w","Oh YES! I thought his look was so familiar for some reason and that's why. I've just never seen them in their uniforms in a colored photo before but still, I just kept thinking his uniform looked so familiar...thank you for clarifying for us all what exactly that uniform is. That was a great idea, and a great part of Guilded Age history to highlight. Well, they were soldiers in the 1800s fighting Native American tribes for the US government's distubing idea of Manifest Destiny, so it's not a ""great"" part of history, but more like a very important part of history. The Native American tribes they were fighting were the most skilled fighters. Apache, Comanche, etc. The Comanche were arguably the best cavalry fighters to ever, ever exist. Fighting them alone would have been...let's just say, you'd send your very best. I expect they did considering the Comanches eventually lost the Indian wars. Plus the Buffalo Soldiers are considered the first Park Rangers. Should be brought into the history books more often. The only way I ever learned about them was by listening to Bob Marley. üôÑ
 
""American Plains Indians who fought against these soldiers referred to the black cavalry troops as ""buffalo soldiers"" because of their dark, curly hair, which resembled a buffalo's coat and because of their fierce nature of fighting.

"PbRZcvVnF0w","The thing that bothers me about Kim wearing that dress is that I think for so many girls/women, Marilyn was and still is a body positivity icon. She had a very natural womanly shape with pointy breasts (which I think most women have, I don‚Äôt think most women have perfectly rounded breasts all the time without support), she had defined hips and a waist and stomach was soft and had bits that overlapped and created little rolls and she had a normal little bump where most women do due to their uterus. And she looks like the every woman, of course women have different body shapes but when I see Marilyn in that dress I see my own body and I think a lot of women would. Kim on the other hand, has single handedly lead a whole lot of women and young girls to have body dysmorphia and believe that they should have the body of a barbie doll and attempt to live up to the absolutely impossible standard that is Kim Kardashians body. Kims body is her body and of course she is entitled to look how she does, but she is absolutely not by any means a champion of body positivity. I mean her and her family have advertised diet teas and lollipops ffs. I just don‚Äôt think Marilyn would stand by any of that. And thats why I have such an issue with Kim wearing that dress. Kim and Marilyn are both icons in regards to their bodies but in extremely different ways, thats fine because women dont need to be carbon copies of each other, but Kim comparing herself to Marilyn in that way is an absolute joke and its insulting tbh.","@isabellasims1346","0","2022-05-15","00:00:00","2022","2022"

It was exactly what it was described as - parts of different dresses sewn together.
Colors did not compliment each other, glove sleeves were out of place, and color of the dress itself was in direct conflict with hair and choker.
Also, lace and flower looked cheap.

There was more to be done for a cohesive look.

Either go for a respectable woman of the period look, and have some more pastel color in the hair - headband, feathers, hat, anything. Throw away those sleeves and get white or pastel gloves and color-fitted choker.
Some jewellery in pink or green like massive but elaborate earrings with necklace could work well too.
Or go for a courtesan look - but then the dress itself should be in bright colors, mix of red&black or green&black would have been great.","@EveRosell","0","2022-05-15","00:00:00","2022","2022"

She definitely didn't practice ""intuitive eating"". The ""pointy breasts"" are from something called the bullet bra, we have pictures of her in a bikini, her stomach was flat and she clearly used corsets (like most actresses). She did have a slight bump you're correct there, but that bump is literally just fat (which is fine) unless you're pregnant/postpartum the uterus is a very small organ, no where near large enough to cause the stomach to distend.","@faemaiden5090","0","2022-05-15","00:00:00","2022","2022"

    I have no skin in this game, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs terrible that Cartier bought & restore it.  Nor does it bother me that they lent it out the choker part of the necklace to be worn by Chamberlain at a gala event.  It wasn‚Äôt damaged at the event.  What is jewelry for, if not to be worn?

I think all of you are being dramatic and overeating.

Scientifically, it is obvious she cannot, fit into Monroe's dress because their statistics is different, no matter how much weight Kim lost.

Besides, if truly you know about the dress, it's said to already be so delicate,it has holes in some places that's beyond repair and what not. So if she wore it, we would have seen all the deformities.

This is a little white lie that has got you all breathing steam for nothing.

Also, even if by some miracle (highly unlikely) if, which I strongly doubt! So what if Kim wore Monroe's dress, isn't it to honour the late actress. What did Kim do? Did she murder, rape, steal, abuse or commit an unimaginable crime?
Is Monroe a saint herself? Did she die a virgin? Or for a just cause? That no one, much LESS, THE Kardashians cannot wear her dress.

If you want to argue based on the delicacy of the dress, and it's rarity, I understand. But just because a fellow human wore it, you're being venomous, please stop.","@duchessromola8893","0","2022-05-15","00:00:00","2022","2022"

However, being a Marilyn stan, fashion critique or neither, these kind of comments were not necessary. They were actually really messed up. Marilyn M. and Kim K. are different people from different origins and times, this is true but the things we're saying about Kim, they're pretty similar to the nasty things Marilyn M. had to hear when she was alive (not cool ayo). Also, treating her like a child, making up these ""I am Marilyn"" interpretations on top of treating her like trash is not cool. Just because she's Kim K. and there are things she does or says that we don't necessarily agree or take a liking to, doesn't mean we can just continuously trash her like she's not even human.

The gilded age was smack right into the Art Nouveau artistic movement. More languid, drapey, florals, bright colors because artificial dyes were in at the time.

"PbRZcvVnF0w","¬†@emc7056¬† And what if they have some similarities in their careers and lifes ? It doesn't change the fact that Marilyn even if she was seen as a bad person back then is today an icon and her possessions are historical artefacts that should stay in a museum because her story, persona and career lead to big changes in our society and impact the way feminity is viewed even today. The jewels from Hepburn are stones which can survive to a red carpet but this dress is already 60y old, it is extremely fragile and is now damaged because of Kim K and her need to be assimilated as an icon by appropriation of someone's biggest fashion statements and not just with a respectful homage. Kim could've worn the replica without having to endangered herself with a dangerous weight loss and still show the parallel between herself and the story of Marilyn. She didn't have to damage an historical garment to make her statement because the similarities between them are already here. Wearing the replica of the dress and saying to the world that she pays homage to Marilyn while respecting her wish to be the only one to ever wear this dress would've been the perfect way to be a Marilyn for a day and show how she is becoming an icon herself in a similar way but without damaging an historical piece. My mom's brooch inherited from her mother was her little treasure and she told me that she didn't want anyone to wear it because it was already damaged and fragile. She died in 2018 and her brooch is in her little box in my bedroom ever since. I often look at it to think about her and our memories together and all of my family regularly ask me about this tiny brooch but I'll never wear it and would never allow anyone to do so because it is extremely fragile and because the wish of a deceased person is still a wish we have to honor and my children will learn to respect their Grandmother's wish like we all should've learn to respect Marilyn's wish to let her dress untouched after she wore it, Kim missed an opportunity to be respectful and show restraint and grace.","@kleineoOoStern","0","2022-05-15","00:00:00","2022","2022"

"PbRZcvVnF0w","¬†@emc7056¬† They are not remotely the same. Marilyn Monroe had to fight worse misogyny in the the 50's than Kim probably ever will being a celebrity in the 21st century. Marilyn had talent as a model, actress, and singer. She collected more books than diamonds. She supported racial equality. Kim Kardashian is the opposite of Marilyn in almost every conceivable way. Kim is a nepotism baby and her sex tape has been suspected of being orchestrated by her mom, which is the biggest ick factor, but does not compare to the sexism and the sex symbol iconography forced upon Marilyn. Kim is not known for being down-to-earth like Marilyn and as far as I'm aware does not collect books like Marilyn who thought of them as treasures. They're both shrewd business-women, for sure, but Kim is also known for exploiting people and communities. Where Marilyn was outspoken even in her time for equality and supported Ella Fitzgerald by sitting first row at all of her performances, Kim Kardashian as well as her family are known for exploiting minorities for attention and money and culture appropriation of black culture. From wearing culturally significant hair to selling shirts with the images of Tupac and Notorious B.I.G with her family name plastered on it, Kim's comparison to Marilyn Monroe is insulting. Their lives might have some similarities but those are few . Marilyn had talent and was harassed by the media to the point of overdosing while Kim is a nepotism baby who exploits people of color to make more money. They are not remotely on the same level","@gothicavictoria1341","0","2023-05-15","00:00:00","2023","2022"
"PbRZcvVnF0w","¬†@gothicavictoria1341¬† Honestly, your points are weak and we aren't talking about how down to earth Marilyn Monroe was (not that you would know anyway) No one said they were the same, however they are both women who have used being sex symbols as a way to make a living. I'm not a fan of Kim Kardashian, but she did help a woman of colour who was wrongfully incarcerated. What you don't understand is that you are picking one woman apart and putting another on a pedestal, with no actual qualified reason, which is very contradictory and anti-woman in itself.","@emc7056","0","2023-05-15","00:00:00","2023","2022"
"PbRZcvVnF0w","¬†@emc7056¬† ""I know this man is horrifically racist and probably a white supremacist, but he did give money one time to a charity that feeds children in Africa, so he can't be that bad."" To a much lesser extent, ignoring Kim's exploitation and cultural appropriation of the black community just because she helped some people of color in what was a possible publicity stunt sounds really ignorant. Despite your supposed dislike if Kim, you don't show it by defending her actions. I also never said they were the same, I was interpreting your words as comparing Marilyn Monroe to Kim Kardashian, which they aren't even comparable in several regards. Saying that my arguments are weak while then calling me anti woman and contradictory is hypocritical and itself anti-woman. You say I'm incorrect, but you haven't pointed out where I'm wrong. I believe this stems from your misunderstanding of why Marilyn is an icon. Marilyn Monroe came from a working class background, used the dumb blonde stereotype as a bit and a cover, and was and is regarded as a business woman, actress, singer, and supporter of black musicians. Her memory has been whittled down sex symbol who possibly slept with the president. Your lack of understanding of who she actually was is both sad, and the very thing you accuse me of, anti-woman. Criticizing Kim Kardashian for her multiple attempts at black phishing, cultural appropriation, and exploitation of minorities as well as wearing an iconic dress meant for historical preservation is not being anti-woman. Marilyn Monroe did more in her life and means more to people than Kim Kardashian, who is a nepotism baby and grew up in an affluent family in LA, is because of Monroe's journey from a girl from a blue collar family to a Hollywood darling to a woman dragged down and harassed to the point of taking her own life. It's insulting to ignore why Marilyn is iconic to American pop culture and history, call her admirers a cult, and call critics of Kim Kardashian for wearing a piece of history anti-woman. Just because both were women does not mean that Kim meets the same level of honor and iconography as Marilyn. I'm not the one who doesn't seem to know what they're talking about. Kim Kardashian is an exploitative nepotistic business woman who should not have worn a dress literally tailored for a woman far more iconic and culturally significant than she will ever be and calling her as such is not anti-woman. Defending Kim Kardashian, even if you say you don't like her, sounds like a brand of feminism in which women can do no wrong and criticizing women makes you anti-woman. People can and should call her out for wearing the dress of Marilyn Monroe. It's insulting to Monroe's memory to suggest that just because she and Kim share the same sex and have similar struggles with the press absolves the latter from criticism. Even while you say you don't like Kim Kardashian, you are inadvertently putting her on a pedestal for doing something that deserves criticism and ignore the times where she has exploited or attempted to exploit the black community and other minorities and then criticize me for putting Marilyn on a pedestal. Just because Kim did charity one time for incarcerated women does not absolve her of the harm she causes while black phishing for magazine covers or cultural appropriation by wearing culturally significant black hairstyles. Before you comment further on Marilyn Monroe, it might serve you well to do some actual research on her life. Because it really seems to me that you're the one who doesn't actually know who she was or why she's an American icon. You're participating in behavior that is itself anti-woman or at least ignorant by shielding one woman from criticism because of a biased charicature of another and comparing the two as if the two similarities I've mentioned before are all that is needed to absolve the former.

No. You do not know either of those people that you are criticizing/complimenting and you sound silly.

You are arrogant for saying that I ""don't know of my existence"", whatever that means without even knowing who I am besides a stranger on the Internet. Meanwhile you call others anti-woman and use Gen Z as an insult. Saying neither are better or worse while not knowing anything about Marilyn and comparing her to a nepotist like Kim shows how little you know. If you don't understand why Marilyn Monroe is admired long after her death and why she's iconic and Kim isn't, then you can stay in that bubble of yours. There's a good reason why Marilyn is better than Kim and it comes down to how she lived and what she was really like in her private life. You don't want to learn and that's sad to me. Nobody's going to write a song about Kim a decade after she dies because she's problematic and not nearly as iconic. But hey, as you say, let women live, and if you want to defend a deeply problematic, exploitative racist nepo baby and cry about how other women are anti-woman for holding Kim accountable for her actions, that's your prerogative.","@gothicavictoria1341","0","2023-05-15","00:00:00","2023","2022"

"PbRZcvVnF0w","The thing is: Marilyn and Kim are sort of in the same situation, Marilyn Monroe was an iconic sex icon, she still is to the older generation (it‚Äôs really weird when your dad begins simping for a dead actress but you know, it happens) 

Kim Kardashian is sort of the same, although instead of being an iconic actress in black and white films, she‚Äôs famous on Instagram, Twitter and her streaming service isn‚Äôt doing half bad, on top of that both women have their every sex life published. 

Personally I don‚Äôt think Kim Kardashian was doing it out of spite, but because she saw herself in Marilyn Monroe. I agree the dress shouldn‚Äôt be worn (out of fear of the fabric literally being to frail to hold up) but a reconstructed dress (like the one she wore after the red carpet) isn‚Äôt half bad 

Both women aren‚Äôt stupid either, Marilyn, allegedly, had an IQ of 140 something but was told to act dumber to be the ‚Äúblonde bombshell‚Äù 

As much as Kim Kardashian is controversial, her financial statements isn‚Äôt half bad, she‚Äôs capitalised on people finding her to be a sex appeal by launching multiple companies in her own name, some of them have flopped but not all of them (look, you gotta try different avenues and sometimes it doesn‚Äôt work out, I respect it) 

NOW IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE GILDED AGE AND THATS WHAT IM MAD ABOUT. 

This is just a historical analysis for why Kim may have wanted to wear the Marilyn Monroe dress (although I don‚Äôt think Kim has ever been involved with any President‚Ä¶ or alleged to be involved. Except Ye who ran for candidacy)","@laurakastrup","0","2022-05-15","00:00:00","2022","2022"

His outfit is a play on uniforms of the United States Colored Troops (USCT) that were established at the birth of the guilded age in May 1863, a few months after President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation. He is honoring the history of African Americans in America. I think he is one of the few that hit the theme right on its mark this year. Plus the added modern touches such as the gloves and such make it more of an artistic fashion statement inspired by the guilded age as opposed to a costume.

They were African American soldiers, nicknamed the ""Colored Cavalry"" by the Indigenous tribes during the Indian Wars at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.

Where did I even mention her style is a crime? It must be in your head cause I sure as hell didn't write that. 

I think many outfits of her new style are not as flattering as they could be, which is strange, since she has a good figure to begin with. And my harmless, unhateful opinion on that and my personal opinion on a style of cleavage, is nothing you can forbid me or make me look bad for. 
Btw: Billie went to the Met Gala. People are supposed to discuss the outfits, and yes, I dare to comment on how the clothes fit the actual body that presents them. Shocking.

"PbRZcvVnF0w","¬†@mirellalastar¬† apparently you know NOTHING then... ""White goddess"" racist much?  The only person bringing race into a discussion about clothing is YOU.

She is nowhere near goddess status, I don't enjoy her music, I could probably name ONE of her songs.

I do actually agree she does look tired, that's the scummy music industry for you.

It's a scummy industry that seems young people seeking fame and signs they into terrible contracts. Their ""manager"" is chasing their ¬£$% and does little to protect their clients.

But your attitude and racism brought race in a discussion about a DRESS, that chip on your shoulder will weigh you down in life. If you're seeing racism in every conversation I recommend you seek help.

There is more than enough racism, and hate in this world without adding your imagined hatred to it.

It's bad enough that a sexist pig turned a discussion of an outfit into a discussion about a young woman's breasts.

I have no idea what triggered your  hate... Or is it simply a hatred for Billie?    We were NOT discussing her, we were discussing how well her outfit fit the theme of the even this year.","@johexxkitten","0","2022-05-15","00:00:00","2022","2022"

"PbRZcvVnF0w","Ashton Sanders's outfit actually hit the Gilded Age theme pretty accurately.

See, we don't call the Gilded Age ""golden"" for a reason. It's gold /covered/, not made of gold. It seems shiny and glamorous on the outside, but below the surface, it is anything but. The Gilded Age was the era where monopolies like Standard Oil flourished at the expense of the working class, and was rife with the bloodshed of the Civil War. 

I bring this up because Sanders deliberately wore that suit as an homage to the Buffalo Soldiers, an all-Black cavalry that was established in 1866 (well within the bounds of the time period) to fight in the Civil War. As a black man, he would not have gotten to enjoy the luxurious lifestyle of the Astors or the Vanderbilts. Instead, he would likely be on the battlefield fighting for his right to exist or suffering under the extreme conditions of the workforce.

The suit itself is not made to be an exact replica, but to capture the essence of the uniforms worn by the Buffalo Soldiers. It still, however, carries a similar silhouette and incorporates the motif of the blue and gold heralding in a way that is reminiscent, but not 100% historically accurate to the actual clothing the regiments donned as they rode or marched into battle.","@kiwisoup1863","0","2022-05-15","00:00:00","2022","2022"

"PbRZcvVnF0w","Not quite. But close. They were established in 1866. The Civil War ended in April of 1865. They were established for the sole purpose of suppressing, and if necessary, obliterating the American Plains Indians (Apaches, Comanches, Blackfoot, Sioux etc- basically the most advanced fighting tribes) in the US government's disturbing pursuit of ""Manifest Destiny"". The Buffalo Soldiers indeed gave the American Plains Indians hell, and were a crucial factor in their eventual near total annihilation and brutal defeat. The black regiments that fought in the civil war were absolutely NOT the Buffalo Soldiers, though maybe a couple black civil war soldiers that lived and weren't maimed AND decided to continue their occupation in the US military (a rare case indeed) perhaps joined this regiment. Why not. They were paid more doing this than at other jobs and given more respect. The Indians are the ones that actually gave them the nickname ""Buffalo Soldiers"". You can easily remember this by their name and where the buffalo were located. In the west. Whereas the Civil War was fought in the southeastern United States where there were no buffalo. Lol. Here:

""American Plains Indians who fought against these soldiers referred to the black cavalry troops as ""buffalo soldiers"" because of their dark, curly hair, which resembled a buffalo's coat and because of their fierce nature of fighting. The nickname soon became synonymous with all African-American regiments formed in 1866."" -Npc dot gov

Maybe for you it's not important, but for the African American people it was quite important that they received their rights, that they had their own regiment, ... Being in the military, a soldier who is defending his county, that means that it's his home.. he is defending his home.
People too fast and too often misrepresent words, happenings and expressions...
It's like when a woman says "" I love to cook for my husband"" ... A feminist theory ""she is a slave of her husband and has to do chores!!!""
People should absolutely stop trying to find something between the lines in order to have their opinion underlined... it's horrible!
There are so many anti racist people, who are more racist than any other proclaimed racist, nationalists who are in fact chauvinists, and feminists who are man haters.... We should stop with that!!!

Billie Eilish looks like she has 4 breasts. The black hair and black neck ribbon goth look and her body posture sticking out her bum?! Ugh ugh ugh 
Proper Ladies do not act that way. She has a beautiful pastel dress. Finally!
Stop placating these people...there are much more talented designers out here than FAMOUS Name humans. 
Time to bring in ALL new designers to the Met Gala.
Use real people not ""Holly Wood"" 
Cali-Porn-Ya... T&A porn stars ughly! 
The Gilded Age designs came from a mentality and lifestyle that was not exhibited in this show. They were proper men and women with moral values.
Someone slept through that class. 
Time to take off the sunglasses and see the creative talent around the world, from different Countries and their Culture!

Buffalo Soldiers originally were members of the 10th Cavalry Regiment of the United States Army, formed on September 21, 1866, at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. This nickname was given to the Colored Cavalry by Native American tribes who fought in the Indian Wars. The term eventually became synonymous with all of the African-American regiments formed in 1866. Just because he isn‚Äôt dressed like a white upper class man from the period doesn‚Äôt mean he didn‚Äôt fit the theme and isn‚Äôt impeccably dressed.

"PbRZcvVnF0w","The one thing I‚Äôve learned from watching these videos. Hardly anyone ever follows the theme!!!! And I don‚Äôt get why?!?!!!!! That what makes it fun and funky and not just mundane everyday ‚Äúlet‚Äôs wear a pretty (sexy) dress, or a suit.‚Äù Like shit I would of been happy just to see people try and dress gilded age let alone reimagine it. The dresses from that era are gorgeous!!! Why wouldn‚Äôt someone want to have a moment to wear something we don‚Äôt really get to see anymore. Any gender could have fun with it. Seeing more men in the women cycling clothing, bloomers, would have been amazing. Even would have loved to see more women in bloomers. This was a liberating moment for women and women‚Äôs fashion. Let‚Äôs celebrate it. And it would be such a fun way for men to try more feminine clothing as the twist at the time was how these bloomers was women‚Äôs fashion going more masculine. To not capitalize on this fashion style is an absolute shame with all those ruffles and fabrics and draping. üò≠ But on top of that, NO HATS. The hats are so fun and over the top compared to what we wear now. And NO PARASOLS! COMMON!!!!!! üò§ 

I would jump at the opportunity to dress like this. I sorta think it‚Äôs a shame we don‚Äôt anymore. Idk what it is about this style but it just feels classy. And I‚Äôm not someone who dresses up at all. I never wear dresses. I know that the era itself was not perfect or great for women and really anyone besides white men. Bunch of elitism. But I still can‚Äôt help but think it‚Äôs classy AF. And maybe more gender swapping could have poked fun at it and shown how much the world has changed since then. Even if we aren‚Äôt perfect now, still so much has improved so why not take a twist on history to show that off. And maybe I‚Äôm more in love with a Hollywood fairytale version of the gilded age fashion, but then at least give me that. ü•∫

I‚Äôm just so disappointed at never seeing the theme. Specially when it‚Äôs meant to reference an era of actually history and isn‚Äôt just like a word, but a real point in history that had a distinct style. Use it. It already exist. They didn‚Äôt even have to think that hard just Google a look from that era and copy it. It‚Äôs not like it was a random word and you have to interpret what that word means in fashion. üò´","@cookieridergirl","0","2022-05-15","00:00:00","2022","2022"

The stylists have no excuse for the outfits that really missed the mark.   The clothing worn by the upper clas was heavily tailored ala couture  to the women.   most of this stuff looks too ‚Äúoff the rack for me.  Maybe it is because I have  a background in sawing and tailoring.  that the dresses are supposed to be inspired by, but underboob crop top takes away from everything else.

Secondly, Marilyn never wanted her dresses to be worn, especially this dress, which she helped design as she was inlove with JFK and it she was sewn into the dress to exactly match her skintone etc so she appeared naked but glittering in sequins.

The Marilyn dress was just underwhelming, I'm sure at the time it was revolutionary- the sheer effect, the crystals, the low cut at the back, but in 2022 we've seen so much of those since it just looked like a sparkly sheath dress in nude. It was also matched to Marilyn's skin tone, and cut for Marilyn, Kim isn't Marilyn so it was never going to give the same effect. It seemed like such a pointless moment in the dress?

In fact, this is an event for a fashion museum and for once, at last, it was about the museum, its theme and purpose.

The dress was worn in consultation with conservation experts, used safely, all advice followed, worn for mere minutes.  The stole, so i heard, was an emergency stole because Kym's bottom couldnt fit in it.

If Blake Lively or Billie Eilish had worn it on the red carpet, the reaction would have been completely different.

"PbRZcvVnF0w","¬†@mlbumller¬† That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ a really disgusting, insensitive thing to say on multiple levels. And I say this as someone who has struggled with suicidal thoughts for most of my life. Telling someone to commit suicide or saying you wish they did doesn‚Äôt become okay just because you don‚Äôt like them. We all don‚Äôt like somebody, so when you say that kind of stuff you just normalize the behavior of wishing a traumatic, self-inflicted death on someone bc they‚Äôre unlikable to you personally. And some of those someones may already be on the edge. Suicide is incredibly traumatizing for loved ones for a myriad of reasons and it literally has a contagion factor; it often creates ripples of immense pain in its wake. So for Kim K specifically; her self-inflicted death, were it to happen, would not only deeply traumatize her family, friends, and children, but her visibility would likely result in additional suicides of people completely undeserving of your grossly inappropriate spite.

For all of Kim Kardashian‚Äôs shallow, oblivious, self-obsessed endlessly irritating qualities, I‚Äôd choose ten Kims any day over your self-indulgent, myopic vacuousness.","@Feverm00n","0","2022-05-15","00:00:00","2022","2022"

Where I live, not everyone can afford a leather jacket but if you save the money you can buy a great quality one that will last over 20 years (with proper care) and that are not from luxury brands. Some ""small"" brands even offer a certificate saying how the leather was obtained and teach you how to care for the leather items.","@redrose3977","0","2022-05-15","00:00:00","2022","2021"

I love that you are saying WTF about noone following the theme, I was thinking the somegood. But really most of the time these celebs don't play the theme at all, it's just like the Met Gala is the excuse to go all out and I LOVE IT. Example (one of MANY) : Iman. Now Iman has been to her share of Met Galas which is why I'm picking on her , she doesn't get a pass for acting like a rookie.

And Billie Eilish gave us SUCH Marilyn Monroe and Old Hollywood vibes in that gown, are you kidding me???

In her other hand is a glowing book.. to me references the bible..or any holy book...you have a war in either hand and one that america is so intertwined in for both of these reasons.... wepons?... and religion?
grimes got it on point... shes wearing the original face mask from the dune film.... too which is an ode to old hollywood in a different and new way also covid protecting and her dess was a piece of art....

"ZMrgtotgThk","fyi: This is a little long.
I think that some of iconography/cultural references are being missed. Iman's look imo references the African American experience in America. So I am a white person and I am not saying that I understand the African American in total and I hope that I don't offend people. But I think that Iman's look references Africa with the use of animal motifs. and decoration. A number of important goddesses and gods of the ancient world are portrayed with snakes as a symbol of power. Because the snake sheds it's skin it a symbol of rebirth and renewal. The headdress combined with the hoop skirt I think references Scarlett O'Hara as a symbol of the American South and colonization the oppressors of African Americans and people of color around the world. The visible hoops in the skirt remind me of a cage. The transformation of the southern belle hat into a lion's mane a symbol of great power combined with the snake skin bodice represent the emergence of a powerful people from oppression. 
Jennifer Lopez's look is another example of layered iconography related to the colonization of the American west combined with intense channeling of Cher.
This is probably a bit of a reach but those are my thoughts. Regardless Iman is a stunningly beautiful and powerful woman and this look is amazing. Jennifer Lopez is beautiful too.

"ZMrgtotgThk","I actually think more than half of the people did good on the theme. It‚Äôs just that the theme is so open ended it‚Äôs not going to have a collective sort of look. I saw many people reference the 1920s to old Hollywood(including many that were featured in this video), references to American culture, what it meant for them to be American, and people who kind of just stuck to colors in the American flag. When you look at the exhibit at the met that inspired the theme this makes even more sense (kind of feels like he didn‚Äôt bother). For example, while this wasn‚Äôt my fave Rihanna look her look seemed to be a take on exaggerated casual wear(sort of like a reference to the Lenny kravitz scarf meme; which is featured in the museum).","@thelivingdead6820","0","2022-05-15","00:00:00","2022","2021"

This was her first Met Gala and she absolutely killed it. As an indigenous woman, she represents her origins and the origins of indigenous communities throughout America. It's important to remember that ""American Independence"" does not equate to the Revolutionary war. She also touches on current issues with Native Americans still fighting for their independence on stolen lands filled with the genocide of their people. American independence is an ongoing process. American identity has many faces, not just the Eurocentric vision adopted by our heavily patriarchal and white-washed history.","@emilyg9883","0","2022-05-15","00:00:00","2022","2021"

I don't think these designers wanted to do this theme either since most of the designs either missed the mark or made their model look like they were going to prom. But some hit the theme and I appreciate that, especially those that didn't try to make a political statement while doing so.

I also feel this way about the majority of the garments, especially Billie's dress, she's clearly cool tones so the peach dress clashed a lot with her undertone, it made the dress look wrong, they could have chosen a more cool toned, extreme pink for her which would have been fabulous as she could have referenced Marilyn Monroe with her cool toned blonde moment. So many things were wrong, not because it wasn't the extravaganza, but because it didn't represent America and it didn't look right.

"ZMrgtotgThk","I would've loved to have seen something like a Cali-based/bred/associated singer-actor work with a less established indie American designer with strong eco commitment to reference Bjork's Oscar red carpet 90s Swan Dress, but with a California Condor, with the accompanying Egg Purse done in a material/technique that references the cause of the condors' near-extinction in the 70s (DDT accumulation thinned eggshells, condors reproduce slow; maybe pretty filagree crackling w/ a few delicate missing shards?). Instead of Bjork's more (& I say this with deep fondness + respect) slightly-lumpy-dead-muppet bird version, underscore the idea that the same America that almost snuffed out their condors also brought them back from the brink, via the designer crafting it in such a way that it looks majestic modern iconic & alive instead of taxidermied or limp-abandoned-plushy-wrap. I would've lost my mind seeing some juxtaposed deep cuts of multiple American zeitgeist moments stacked together in an aesthetic + narrative statement like that.
