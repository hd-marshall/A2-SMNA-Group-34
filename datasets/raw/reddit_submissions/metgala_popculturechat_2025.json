    "selftext": "It‚Äôs hard to see from a distance, clear and reflective. Pharrell packed his LV Met Gala designs full of details that aren‚Äôt easily visible in pictures, like the subdued damier squares on Callum Turner‚Äôs suit, or the ‚Äútexture‚Äù background on Doechii.\n\n**I was noticing how most of the buttons on the Pharrell LV suits for Met Gala are pearly looking,** meant to look like mother of pearl. (2nd slide showing Doechii/Pharrell.) It‚Äôs based on the existing practice of actual mother pf pearl buttons. It goes with Pharrell‚Äôs own suit made of pearls (beads?). Also, how **all the various suits have a very subdued pinstripe.** Sabrina‚Äôs fabric is the most subtle, black on black pinstripe.\n\nBut **his one look fits all approach didn't always work.** I think that pinstripe is too hard to see, and could have better 'highlighted' her shape than the buttons. The style went too formal for some when adding the vest for Jeremy Allen White, overpowering the unconventional details. 3rd slide: wide lapel, long sleeves, flared pants.\n\n**I still give him credit for integrating so many custom designs and trying his hand at womenswear** (last slide). **When LV's Nicholas Ghesquiere did a Met Gala entirely with archive looks** that I think people complained about being off theme.",

Most of them aren‚Äôt even in high school yet.\n\nIMO Gen Z is the new kind of boomer (which is why they get called zoomers). They‚Äôre the ones falling for misinformation (sometimes by not even reading past the headline) and using ChatGPT for literally everything including their schoolwork. There are lots of other parallels that generation has with boomers but especially when it comes to being easily scammed and easy to pander to. Plenty of non-political examples here too but the results of the election alone showed me how easily Gen Z is manipulated.",

    "selftext": "\"I‚Äôd never stopped to think about it before, but Shia LaBeouf and Timoth√©e Chalamet have quite a lot in common: They both started out in the industry relatively young, they conduct themselves with a kind of theatrical, earnest intensity, and let‚Äôs not forget their very French surnames. LaBeouf ‚Äî like everyone else on the internet ‚Äî took note of Chalamet‚Äôs completely known¬†A Complete Unknown¬†press tour¬†that culminated in his¬†SAG acceptance speech¬†in which the young star said he wanted to be ‚Äúone of the greats.‚Äù ‚ÄúI so know the feeling. On him, it‚Äôs cute. On me, it wasn‚Äôt cute,‚Äù LaBeouf told¬†The Hollywood Reporter¬†while promoting his new David Mamet film,¬†Henry Johnson.\n\nThe context is important for these comments about Chalamet, which come after LaBeouf discussed how turning to Catholicism protected him from his ego and insecurity. Whereas Chalamet‚Äôs aspirations to be great were pegged as delusional if not goofy, LaBeouf‚Äôs self-seriousness carries a¬†much darker context. That doesn‚Äôt mean that he is shading industry golden boy Chalamet. If LaBeouf was shading anyone with his comments, it‚Äôs himself: He knows¬†he‚Äôs not exactly one for a charm offensive. Before any controversy over LaBeouf‚Äôs comments about Chalamet spread, however, the former posted a screenshot of an¬†email exchange¬†between the two from late 2023.\n\nIn the email, Chalamet writes that LaBeouf was ‚Äútotally electric, totally present at every turn‚Äù in the¬†stage version of¬†Henry Johnson, and LaBeouf writes that Chalamet ‚Äúis doing better work than anyone alive.‚Äù The correspondence is sweet, confirming that Chalamet is definitely the kind of guy to hype you up and put a space before typing¬†two¬†exclamation points and that LaBeouf is the kind of guy who might call you ‚Äúdoggy‚Äù in an email.¬†Henry Johnson¬†did not transfer over to New York after its Los Angeles run, but the movie is¬†available to rent online right now¬†in a distribution method Mamet credited to Louis C.K. Of course, LaBeouf‚Äôs story is much darker than Chalamet‚Äôs, as somewhat chronicled in his semi-autobiographical film¬†Honey Boy, which co-starred the actor‚Äôs then-partner FKA Twigs, who¬†later sued him¬†for sexual assault, battery, and infliction of emotional distress. Though he credits actors Sean Penn, Mel Gibson, and Josh Brolin for help in his recent recovery, LaBeouf also told¬†THR¬†he believes he‚Äôs been blacklisted from the industry. Chalamet‚Äôs email is well meaning and kind, though not representative of any kind of mainstream acceptance of LaBeouf amid his struggles.\n\nWhere‚Äôs Chalamet in all of this? Has he weighed in? Of course not! Don‚Äôt you know that the New York Knicks are in the playoffs right now? The actor skipped the Met Gala to watch his beloved Knicks play, and last night he¬†sat courtside¬†with¬†newly red-carpet-official girlfriend Kylie Jenner. Chalamet is regularly shouting out his heroes, a keen name-dropper and fanboy, so maybe he and LaBeouf can link in the near future on a boys‚Äô date. If nothing else, Chalamet‚Äôs gotta be way more fun to hang out with than Sean Penn.\"\n",

And he used the quantrelle reference speaking about cardi but in another post  in his stories it‚Äôs also used as a descriptor for Nicki‚Äôs look(the cinched waist). The quote above is actually in a video and is worth watching as they show some of the images that inspired him. \nSeparately from what he did for Burberry he fully styled Nicki in Tom Browne, Jeremy Pope in Margiela, Tyla in Jaqumues, Zendaya in Louis Vuitton. I believe Andre 3000 was the only Burberry celeb fully styled by Law.",

    "title": "Doechii Met look breakdown. Lots of history: slavery, early black dandy, Dapper Dan. Wool shorts is her GNX. Why all the logos, face logo? Box + more umbrellas is a joke? Contrasting Kendrick‚Äôs look: also LV + Tiffany",
    "selftext": "Like it or not, her look is like a dissertation expressed through style. It connects the most to the history that‚Äôs this year‚Äôs theme.¬†\n\n* LV on her face: the origins of the black dandy in slavery¬†\n* silhouette: from the style of one of the first free black dandies\n* logos: Dapper Dan. One of the biggest names in black fashion history + NYC link\n\n# Suit shorts\n\nShe loves wool suits with shorts. I think it's a nod to her earlier Thom Browne look at the Grammys. She wore LV suit with shorts a few days ago on IG. Maybe she likes it, as something a little more formal but more casual/comfortable than pants. It‚Äôs a little like Kendrick Lamar‚Äôs GNX car that he used to brand his album/song/tour. If he picked ‚ÄúFerrari‚Äù or some existing car model, it‚Äôs harder to become synonymous with that product. Likewise, **suit with shorts is a niche branding association that she can dominate. Nobody else is doing it. Business-wise, it helps these brands sell something that probably isn‚Äôt too popular.**¬†\n\nSee 4th slide. I think the right pic was during Paris fashion week when she went to see Pharrell: maybe to plan her Met Gala look. I think she wore that to explain to him ‚ÄúGive me something like this.‚Äù I just noticed **she did something crazy: tuck in her tie.**\n\n**Her wool shorts marketing is great for whatever brand she collabs.** They‚Äôre more expensive than cotton. But require less custom tailoring than pants. There‚Äôs less ‚Äúfriction‚Äù for customers that don‚Äôt want that hassle. She could say in negotiations ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the biggest seller of wool shorts in the world!‚Äù I think Thom Browne tried making these a thing. It‚Äôs her monopoly üòÇ\n\n# Patterns, ‚Äútexture‚Äù\n\nI feel like this is a little bit like a visual version of Anxiety. A somewhat polarizing version of a well-known sample. But there's much more to it. LV = the sample in this analogy. I think she's going all out on the logo look just to indulge. No longer just the girl with \"no logos.\" Visually, I‚Äôm not a fan bc it‚Äôs so busy, but I appreciate what she‚Äôs doing.¬†\n\n**It intentionally ‚Äúbreaks the rules‚Äù: patterns on patterns. Here, her shirt is white, but suit, vest, collar, pants all have colliding patterns.** It flips the typical patterned (like striped) shirt, which isn‚Äôt supposed to go with another pattern on the suit, like pinstripes. Notice the collar is the only part of the top that‚Äôs has LV‚Äôs damier squares. **It also references Dapper Dan, best known for reworking Gucci/LV logos onto outfits for 80s rappers like Eric B and Rakim.** Or Jam Master Jay (3rd slide). He‚Äôs one of the icons of black style, and his own look fits ‚Äúblack dandy.‚Äù¬†\n\n**Fabric texture.** It definitely looks better in clearer pictures, where you can see it resembles a **raised pattern.** On closer look, I think it might just be color that‚Äôs printed/woven for that effect. Regardless, **this brings to mind LV bags: both canvas and the grain on its leather. It also visually connects to the blazer that Pharrell wore at the same event, made with 100,000 pearls.** He designed both that and Doechii‚Äôs outfit. Two different styles of craziness.\n\nI like it with the ‚Äútexture‚Äù more, **but the patterns is the opposite of Kendrick‚Äôs legendary all black Virgil Abloh LV (last slide).** **That look was great for highlighting the Tiffany jewelry he wore. Maximum contrast.** There‚Äôs a lot of good details on that suit too, when compared to the black suit of Jon Batiste at the 2025 Super Bowl. He went for a similar look, but his designer suit just doesn‚Äôt hit the same.¬†\n\nDoechii is also wearing Tiffany jewelry (probably much more expensive than Kendrick‚Äôs), **but I barely noticed her 12 carat yellow diamond brooch.** The patterns are ‚Äúmaximalist,‚Äù but Pharrell‚Äôs own ridiculous pearl jacket is maximalism that‚Äôs less cluttered. I do think the texture probably makes the outfit that look much better in person; it looks good on video. I know this is meant to break the rules. Maybe it‚Äôs even Pharrell in defiance of that Virgil look. Breaking all the rules, including letting Doechii do her thing with shorts.¬†\n\n**Note that the watch has a mother of pearl dial. It connects to jacket buttons** that look mother of pearl, but I think are another material.\n\n# ‚ÄúTexture‚Äù pattern connects to LV history\n\n**Doechii‚Äôs outfit ties not only to bags, but to LV‚Äôs original product:** travel trunks for the elite. It is the only LV look that does this. It‚Äôs likely Pharrell learned some of this. \n\n**Louis Vuitton was the first fashion adjacent product branded with a prominent logo.** (From the book Deluxe.) The company ‚Äúinnovated‚Äù with a luggage trunk made from waterproof canvas, featuring a flat top. Lighter than leather that was previously used, and it could be stacked, unlike rounded top trunks (think treasure chest). But this wasn‚Äôt that hard to copy. So they made a damier pattern was meant to be harder to counterfeit. To let people know it was the original ‚ÄúLouis Vuitton.‚Äù The monogram logo came later, with the same purpose.They made waterproof leather too.¬†\n\nI can only think of the outfit overshadowing the jewelry making sense in this historic context. LV made luggage that carries precious items for people like the Empress of France. They traveled with dozens of trunks carrying all their portable markers of wealth. Including elaborate dresses; or large, expensive, fragile sets of porcelain. It‚Äôs like Doechii‚Äôs clothes are an analogy for LV luggage carrying jewelry.¬†\n\nI think LV used trunks as such a metaphor when it did a deal to carry the trophies for NBA (made by Tiffany), before their parent company‚Äôs deal with Tiffany closed. Basically representing the not so friendly acquisition.¬†\n\nJust doing mental association. Even if this is what they were thinking with the jewelry, I think it‚Äôs better in concept than appearance. An actual leather coat would look better, but probably be hot to wear all night.\n\n# History. So many 18th c details. Dapper Dan\n\nHer photoshoot from the side shows the resemblance to the 18th century men‚Äôs tops. And to the inspiration for the outfit, Julius Soubise. See 1st slide for these details:\n\n1. **That crazy flap in the back: ‚Äúcoattails.‚Äù** But why is it rounded like a beaver tail? I feel like it‚Äôs not ‚Äúelegant‚Äù like the hybrid coattail/dress train on Sabrina Carpenter‚Äôs Pharrell LV (5th slide). It‚Äôs not the flat, straight edge typical of menswear, and appears to be that Soubise is wearing. **This rounded tail gives a playful feel that‚Äôs neither too masculine or feminine. It‚Äôs actually like a coattail/dress train hybrid as well.** Just all round, like a dress, no straight lines like Sabrina Carpenter‚Äôs. A more feminine detail than it first appears.\n2. **The coat leaves the belly/vest exposed**, unlike a modern suit jacket.¬†\n3. Her tie is like the 1700s men's style.¬†\n4. **Her personal preference for suit shorts, socks, shoes happens to align with the 1700s too.**¬†\n5. **The black shoes with a big buckle is a key link. Is this the only time she wore shoes with a buckle?**\n6. Even her fro matches Soubise‚Äôs hair and round looking hat in the picture.\n7. **Logo = flash.** Soubise was a flashy dresser for his time, but today an outfit directly copying the drawing would just look old and formal. **The visual logo flood is a way to bring flashiness back to an 18th century look.**\n\nIt is very different from the other Pharrell LV Met looks, on himself, his wife, and Sabrina Carpenter. (5th slide, LV Met Gala group pic.) All the other looks are much more subdued in color/pattern, even if the details or silhouette are extravagant: Pharrell‚Äôs pearls, the crystals on Pusha T‚Äôs suit, faces on Lisa‚Äôs underwear, and Sabrina Carpenter‚Äôs outfit. The picture is intentionally dark, but **the other palette/patterns are almost aggressively neutral. There was some coordination to make Doechii the only branded outfit.** It‚Äôs like she‚Äôs wearing the logos for the whole group!\n\n**Her logos are unique in the show: basically the only visible logos.** (There‚Äôs the small double Cs on Jennie‚Äôs hat.) **Doechii‚Äôs look becomes the only reference in the show to Dapper Dan‚Äôs signature style.** (Including other designers, even Dapper Dan himself.) That style is historic, and links the Met Gala to NYC fashion. The same kind of creativity that created hip hop. Like a form of sampling.\n\n**Arguably, his work repurposing Gucci and LV logos helped make these brands cool.** I‚Äôve read that LV, maybe up to the 90s was almost entirely leather goods: no clothes. In the 80s, it was in the process of trying to attract younger clientele. Shift from old customers who liked old fashioned luggage. He made old brands young and flashy. He played a role turning these bag brands into something male rappers wanted to flex and name drop.¬†\n\nHe‚Äôs likely an inspiration for Kanye getting into fashion. And Pharrell himself working for LV, which is the main sponsor for this year‚Äôs Gala. He‚Äôs the one Gala co-chair known as a designer. Dapper Dan paved the way. This show and the look brings his legacy full circle. Pharrell knew Dapper Dan was going to be there as a host and that he needed an outfit to honor him. The way Doechii is a student of rap history made her the perfect match.¬†\n\n# Face logo\n\n**She actually said her outfit is inspired by a history book \"Slaves to Fashion.‚Äù** The book is also the basis for this year‚Äôs Gala theme. I suspected the makeup was intentionally like a literal \"brand\" meant to elicit slavery. Referencing the scars on her earlier Anxiety song art. **To me, that book basically confirms this.** **It's like reclaiming \"branding\" for black people.** There‚Äôs a few layers to it.¬†\n\n1 Most straightforward. **Her LV is black designed by Pharrell.** Just as the book talks about how black dandyism itself originated in slavery, masters dressing up their house slaves. Yet it became an outlet for self-expression and public creativity for free (not slave) black men during unfree times.\n\nIt‚Äôs intentionally provocative. A savage flip, like using the song title ‚ÄúSomebody That I Used To Know‚Äù to refer to dead victims of racial profiling. Or reminding us of how ‚ÄúShake It Off,‚Äù Taylor Swift‚Äôs song ties to Eric Garner (given the timing).\n\n2 **A nod to things like Fenty Beauty by Rhianna,** which is part owned by the same parent company as LV. A black woman making more shades of makeup for all, after decades of modern, global cosmetics brands. Making it‚Äôs easier for black women to find matching shades. It‚Äôs a very literal celebration of this makeup.\n\n3 **Visually ties to her Anxiety song art,** where she has the scars that go up her neck. I‚Äôve said that the scars represent George Floyd and Eric Garner. I just found out that the song art was part of her earlier ABNH photoshoot. This makes more sense since it brings to mind ‚Äúalligator bites‚Äù more than anything.¬†\n\n**I still think the edit with two of her is meant to link to Floyd and Garner.** In the shoot, she has the fake scar on only one side. For the picture, they decided to show both sides with the scar. **There‚Äôs a decision to emphasize the connection to the ‚Äújugular‚Äù line.** A decision to emphasize a lethal looking scar and on a black and white, shirtless picture. Combined with the ‚Äúold film‚Äù effect on the visualizer, I think she‚Äôs steering us away from the ABNH title. The combination elicits the well-known picture of the slave whose back is covered in scars. It wasn‚Äôt originally for the Anxiety concept, but is edited in a way that fits.\n\nSo it‚Äôs not the first time she uses fake scars to connect to racism. This time is more explicit: more people are calling out the association. It‚Äôs ‚Äújust style,‚Äù but I think this kind of reminder is better than nothing. It shows her ongoing consistency with this message, and how much she‚Äôs thinking about it, even if few others notice. **From the Anxiety itself, to both versions of song art. To the cop car starting the** [Dsquared2 fashion show](https://www.reddit.com/r/DOECHII/comments/1k7a3q0/doechiis_fashion_show_debut_at_dsquared2_her/)**.**¬† To the MV ending when the glass shatters, reminding us of the [SWAT team shown earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/DOECHII/comments/1k6ifyj/anxiety_why_doechii_can_only_mean_eric/). To even her interest in filming in a slave cemetery ([as someone posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/DOECHII/comments/1k761r6/doechii_apparently_wanted_to_film_a_music_video/)). **Note this ‚Äúbrand‚Äù is the only reference in the fashion show to the origins of black dandy in slavery.**¬†\n\nTo me, it reinforces that the song art is about police brutality.\n\n4 It helps her look evoke **several different eras.** The brand and silhouette goes 18th c. The fro: 70s. Logos: Dapper Dan 80s. Her whole look is so busy, it really is almost like a thesis as style. Like a good thesis, there‚Äôs some originality that people aren‚Äôt going to like.¬†\n\n5 **It‚Äôs like Kendrick Lamar‚Äôs diamond encrusted crown of thorns.** Very commercial, provocative, some deeper meaning/misunderstood, and she‚Äôs probably not going to explain it. **It‚Äôs already in the suggested search results, as ‚Äústamp‚Äù and ‚Äúcheek.‚Äù**\n\nCynically, it‚Äôs a low cost way to get **‚Äúearned media.‚Äù** Coverage/attention for something ‚Äúnewsworthy‚Äù that person/company doesn‚Äôt have to ask for. I don‚Äôt think this is something LV asked from her, since they don‚Äôt have cosmetics yet. I get the sense parent company LVMH likes mild controversy. **Yet they do not want racial controversy. The kind that‚Äôs hit their competitor Kering (Gucci) hasn‚Äôt been good for business.** The makeup feels like Doechii‚Äôs style.\n\n# Box ‚Äúreveal,‚Äù cruelty: it‚Äôs a joke\n\nNote: Not defending this behavior if I‚Äôm wrong about this. I‚Äôm not a stan, if you haven‚Äôt noticed my dislike of the outfit. I called her out on what sounded [like a lyrical mistake.](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1kcs23g/comment/mq9h9ux/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\nI think the box itself is meant as a joke and her yelling is part of the act. Where did the box come from? How would she know they brought enough umbrellas? I‚Äôm surprised nobody thought of this. Both people attacking her and fans saying that it‚Äôs her ‚Äúanxiety.‚Äù You can see in one of the original videos she reveals her outfit ‚Äúby accident‚Äù without the box, at the start. **It‚Äôs diva satire. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want these fuckin people to see me‚Äù: she‚Äôs explaining the box joke.** It‚Äôs not so much about whether the outfit was worth the set up. This is why she‚Äôs making a scene in front of photographers and being loud. She wants people to hear the act.¬†\n\n**Elaborate, not breaking character humor. It‚Äôs like Kendrick Lamar‚Äôs one acting role: playing a crackhead.** Or him dressing up as Kung Fu Kenny as a joke for Don Cheadle, and Cheadle didn‚Äôt even get it. Doechii seems the type to be full of ideas and want to put on a show. Like she said she‚Äôs ‚Äúa theater kid.‚Äù You see this in her Anxiety MV (I‚Äôm personally not a big fan).\n\nI don‚Äôt think she‚Äôll explain it further. I‚Äôd guess she‚Äôs a little surprised nobody got it too. Like Kendrick wearing crown of thorns covered in diamonds: he was waiting for someone to connect his actual message. I would think she‚Äôs aware of the risk, and considered things like Blackpink saying the n word yet getting a pass. Makes me wonder if she wants to keep experimenting things people don‚Äôt understand.\n\n# Interesting ideas. less is more\n\nHer whole show brought out a lot of artistry from her and Pharrell. It‚Äôs much more than a bunch of logos. **Is she the only person who mentioned the book that was the basis for this year‚Äôs theme?** I do want her to keep challenging herself this way, like a true artist. Even if the audience doesn‚Äôt get it I‚Äôm not a big on the look itself, but the thought that went into it is really interesting. Yet most don‚Äôt judge fashion by digging into every possible reference. \n\n**Last slide shows Kendrick‚Äôs famous Virgil Abloh fit on the right. Like Doechii‚Äôs look, it‚Äôs also Louis Vuitton with Tiffany jewelry. It just hits, no explanation needed.** It‚Äôs one of his/rap‚Äôs defining fits. So much so that it‚Äôs on the cover of [official book for the Met costume exhibition about this year‚Äôs Gala theme ](https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/superfine-tailoring-black-style)(scroll down). That look is clearly modeled after Kendrick‚Äôs. (The picture caption says it‚Äôs a 2025 Wales Bonner fit, a black brand he rapped about.) But I think Pharrell would want to avoid the excessive militant/masculine energy of Kendrick‚Äôs look.\n\nBut I think there ways for ideas in this Met look to work better. Continue to make it a thing. Evolve it with different colors. Make it more subdued like the other Pharrell Met designs. There has to be a way to do flashy color as a modern connection to the flashiness of Soubise, without clashing so much. True to Dapper Dan, not this visual kaleidoscope.\n\nThis kind of unique jacket gives variety to her suit shorts silhouette. **More fitted/long jacket moves her away from the underlying Thom Browne resemblance.** These concepts are worth more than a visual dissertation: they could look dope too, while keeping all the originality.",

He designed the outfit and it would have been him working with Anna since he was on the committee, and Anna has the power to tell people no, their outfits are too similar, but then she didn't. Is it too much of a tin foil hat to feel like this is a little back-stabby by Anna Wintour?",

She asked him \"Are you excited to be at the Met Gala\" given that it was first time.\n\nAnd Tik Tok was outraged.\n\nWhile some are blasting Ego for not really knowing how big of a star SRK is. People from \"small town in England\" to \"village in Burnina Faso\" to \"favela in Brazil\" are saying that even they grew up watching SRK's work. They say that she should have shown more respect and that SRK is more famous that the Met itself. \n\nOn the flip side, others are saying that they have no idea who SRK is and that Bollywood is niche in the west (including America and LATAM). And that Ego wasn't being rude for asking him that question since it actually was his first time. \n\nWhere do you fall?\n",

It's super basic. From my understanding SRK is ASTRONOMICALLY famous. But there isn't anything on the sheet that would delineate that. Cuz \"Beyonce Knowles-Carter, Singer\" is exactly the same as \"Chappel Roan, singer.\" and if you didn't know either women, the basic sheet isn't gonna delineate that Beyonce is a MUCH bigger deal than Chappel. You know their names and their profession. That's it. \n\n  \nIt would say \"SRK Bollywood Actor\" and that would be it. \n\nIf they have an assistant then the they may lean down and say \"This is Beyonce. She's a big deal.\" but like Chappel is also a big deal. But you would react SO differently meeting Beyonce vs Chappel. \n\n  \nI think people wanted a Beyonce level reverence to SRK. But that requires a bit more backstory that I think Ego or Tyanna were given.",

Do you remember when reporters made THE QÃ∂uÃ∂iÃ∂nÃ∂cÃ∂yÃ∂ JÃ∂oÃ∂nÃ∂eÃ∂sÃ∂ step aside to interview Chapelle because they were more excited to see her? Does that automatically mean Chapelle Roan is more famous/bigger/more impactful to the music industry than Quincy Jones? No. But that's the type of reasoning you'll use for any other nationality. \n\nAnother question, how did you feel about the Rosa Parks underwear? Did it ever occur to you to dismiss the \"outrage\" by saying Rosa Parks just isn't \"famous enough\" in Thailand for her to be respected?\n\nEdit: mistakenly said Quincy instead of Babyface and I'm leaving it up but I have been corrected already.\n\nEdit 2: actually cannot with the casual xenophobia and propping up of US in this thread so I'll stop responding to weirdos now but to address a couple of re-occurring things in my replies: \n\n- Yes i meant Babyface, not Quincy Jones. I apologise. \n\n- I don't care if it was actually Rosa Parks or not, I asked whether the other person ever felt inclined to dismiss the outrage as it was happening. Regardless of who that was, was any of your first instincts to excuse it? No? Then why is it your first instinct when it's this instance? And if it was your first instinct, why? Why would you be happy to excuse something like that? \n\n- for the last and final time, I don't think every single human being on earth knows who SRK is. Most people have probably never seen him in a movie or a show or floating around the internet. That's fine. I'm not here to debate the status of icon. My only argument is, if you as a country go out of your way to invite people from all over the world for the benefit of your country, the least you can do is make sure the official reporters on YOUR red carpet know wtf they're doing. They can even just have assistants for that stuff, we've all watched The Devil Wears Prada. We know how easily it can be done. It's just the lack of respect while attempting to pander to an indian audience. We all know we would be outraged if it happened any other way, as has been proven time and time again. I'm asking y'all to take a second and introspect about why it's annoying for you to have indians demand the same level of respect given to any other guest to one of theirs. \n\nPeace out y'all ‚úåüèæ",

She was filming Wednesday all the way through Friday, then she had to fly out on Sunday ahead of Beetlejuice promo beginning on Monday. So the only day where she had nothing work related going on was Saturday.\n\n\nAnd you watch that video and read the plans and its so smart how efficient they made it. They rented a mansion in Beverly Hills that had all the locations they needed, no need to travel. The video, I think both for the story being told and knowing Jenna only had one day, very smartly only requires 1 prosthetic when she gets the knife through the eye. Sabrina who can get fitted a bit more and can plan out the scenes is the one who gets most of the stunts and prosthetics and blocking and whatnot. They made it so easy for Jenna.¬†",

First, it‚Äôs hilarious that people were so bent out of shape about this being racist and disrespectful when no one apparently had enough respect to, I don‚Äôt know, verify the identity of the lady on the panties. Second, there were other portraits of probable Black women in the same area‚Äîand ALL OVER THE BODY SUIT. Why was no one outraged for them? And, for the love of god, WHO WAS PRINTED ON LISA‚ÄôS TITTIES? Shouldn‚Äôt we think of them?!\n\nLike, I get that context is important when considering racism in America. But this is literally not even the first time that Henry Taylor‚Äôs portraits have been used for LV; for Pharrell Williams‚Äô collection, there were faces plastered on clothes covering various body parts. And Pharrell was a co-chair for this specific event, which was about tailoring Black style. And he and Taylor both were involved in this specific outfit. \n\nI‚Äôm not going to claim that Lisa seems 100% NOT racist. But her wearing this bodysuit, which had multiple Black contributors to it who do not seem fucking alarmed, to a Black style event is NOT inherently a racist thing to do, which is what a LOT of commenters were saying. Especially because it‚Äôs apparently some other Black lady that was near her crotch, surrounded by a bunch of other unidentified Black ladies that no one was complaining about‚Äîwhich, in my opinion, is pure comedy.",

Pharrell licensed these portraits and this is how they made it onto Lisa's lace bodysuit and blazer. Henry Taylor and Future were in the ‚Äúmicro-embroidered‚Äù suits at the gala. They're in that group LV shot with Doechii, Pusha and Sabrina. Adapting the micro-embroidered portraits onto the lace obviously means losing the colour and turning them into line drawings. They're simplified.\n\nSo, if your position is that Pharrell licensed another portrait from Henry Taylor of Rosa Parks, are you able to point to that original portrait by him? Has he ever done a portrait of Rosa Parks? Or is your position that along with the Henry Taylor portraits of people from his life, Pharrell decided to include one of Parks?\n\nOr is it at all possible that the lace line drawing version of Henry Taylor's portrait of his neighbour just bears some resemblance to the famous photo of Rosa Parks?\n\nFull disclosure, I'm her fan. I freaked when I first saw the tweets but it doesn't seem possible now. Like, is it impossible you're mistaken about this?",

Once I learned she said the n-word as a trainee, whatever little respect I had vanished.\n\nBut here the backlash feels bizarre.. she didn‚Äôt design the look‚Äîa respected designer did‚Äîand even if she made some minor choices, the responsibility ultimately lies with him. As I said, if this were an Indian event and I‚Äôd chosen to include culturally significant art, I would make sure it isn‚Äôt styled disrespectfully. Not just out of responsibility to my client, but out of respect for my own culture. It‚Äôs kinda wild how none of the blame is touching him. I sorta even feel bad for her, which is fucking insane.\n\nBut thank you for the background info!",

    "selftext": "Was I the only person who thought too many of the outfits just fell flat? When I think of Dandyism I think of tailored, I think of pops of color, I think of fun fabrics. There were so many just black and white outfits and many of the people who were wearing suits were way off the mark when it comes to Black American Inspired Dandyism. And then on top of that... so many of the people had designers that were... white people. I thought the whole point was to showcase Black design and designers??? It wasn't what I expected from some of the most gorgeous people on the planet. I feel like they could have made some careers if Thom Browne hadn't designed half of the very meh looks.\n\nEdit: Just so everyone is aware, more than one celebrity bought a table, some of the celebrities were not dressed by designers who had tables and still wore clothes by white designers, if it looks enough like Rosa Parks that people think Rosa Parks is on someone's coochie that's really on the designer and it's bad taste, the theme absolutely was about Tailoring BLACK Design not having white people design black and white clothes, and people have always been encouraged to dress on theme and inspired by the exhibit. On theme was Tailoring Black Design and the exhibit is about Black Dandyism. I read the releases that were sent out with breakdowns and what style should be expected, I've loved fashion since I was a child. Saying I am uneducated about this or being racist because I, a white person, think that Black Designers should have been worn to a Gala themed in Black Fashion, am racist is... some wild ass Reddit takes.

The Gala is a cultural gateway, not just a financial one. \nAlso, more broadly, the Met Gala is an opportunity for designers to be able to present more original creations than on ordinary red carpets and therefore to bring fashion to life (from the past as well as the present).

And I think some invitees are not going to want to  invest the time and effort in working with a designer every single year, especially if they don't have a project to promote.  Many celebrities really are not very stylish left to their own devices - they wear costumes on set and work with stylists.  On the other hand, people like SJP really are students of fashion and devote a lot of time into  developing their looks.  (Although she was not there this year.)  And then there is the Anna Wintour of it all - who is said to have a lot of say in what attendees wear. And then there is the whole fundraising aspect of the Gala.  The event is trying to do and be a lot of things all at once.",

Because people overreact like this it‚Äôs impossible to voice opinions without being labeled a transphobe.\nWhen legislating you have to be as clear as possible or it opens too many windows for loopholes.\nPersonally I have no problem with trans people, calling them the pronouns they chose and overall treating them as the gender they are transitioning into, but I do have concerns with the legal aspects of giving someone born as a male the legal status of a woman.\nTaking your example. Let‚Äôs say you legislate that trans women be allowed into women‚Äôs toilets and changing rooms. It becomes very hard to regulate and define a trans woman. Is it every person that considers themselves a trans woman? Only those who have started transitioning? Those who have had genital surgery? And how do you check for these things. The end result is every pervert and creep can bend this law to their advantage. Should a trans male be taken to a male prison? Should a trans female be taken to a female prison? You would suddenly find a lot of people that quickly start the minimum amount of transition for the legal requirement, none of which are a benefit to the trans community. \nMy point is that it‚Äôs a complicated issue that shouldn‚Äôt be reduced to the absurd.",

She wore a small part of it, as the original necklace is worth $2.5 billion and to my understanding, it's no longer fully in one piece. Since then it's been sealed away in a museum.\n* Diljeet Dosanjh requested to wear it (unclear if they mean the entire necklace, or the single part Emma Chamberlain wore), but Cartier declined, saying that it's in the museum and now unavailable for loan.\n* The reason the necklace in the first pic looks very different than the one Emma wore is because its based on the FULL Patiala necklace, not the small segment.\n\nAll that said, sure, it seems plausible it's too fragile to wear now, but then I think it was certainly a *choice* to let Emma wear it in the first place. It's a piece of stolen Punjabi history (it \"disappeared\" from the Royal Palace in the 1940s and its pieces were \"found\" in London in the 1980s, where Cartier purchased it). Frankly I don't think Cartier should have it, or have the right to loan it out, in the first place.",

They were paying Cartier. \n\nMany of such jewellery was **secretly sold** during the time of Independence (1947) as they didn't want the assets to be counted among public assets. **Patiala necklace mysteriously disappeared and the valuable diamonds were auctioned off**. \n\n**Cartier acquired the remaining pieces of the necklace and replaced the missing gemstones with less expensive shiny stones**. What you see in their collection **isn't the actual Patiala necklace with precious stones like the DeBeers diamond**. It is a skeleton dressed with cheap rocks. Cartier is free to do whatever they like with their acquisition. \n\nAs an Indian I find it weird that no one is enquiring \n\n* Why was s public servant like the king of Patiala commissioning such work to foreigners and spending huge amounts of money on himself when it could have been used for schools, hospitals and other public welfare institutions?\n\n* Why are random people (even some stupid westerners) crying about it when the rich and powerful royal heirs don't give a fuck about it? One of them is a jeweller ü§≠ The son of the last attested owner is a very influential politician. \n\n[Amarinder Singh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amarinder_Singh)\n\nThe heirs aren't the ones crying about it.

British India was only discarded (sorry - ‚Äúliberated‚Äù - ‚Äúpeacefully!‚Äù) because the administration of the empire became no longer profitable for the Brits in the face of the industrial revolution.

Many are later embarrased and wished they hadn't done that, but its not anyone elses fault. \n\nThere are Picasso's now in Indian billioanire mansions that belonged to spanish royalty and were sold on auction, there are Turner pieces that instead of the National Gallery or Tate in London are in the private property of Saudi Prince's and some of those families will show up in 50 years talking about how it was stolen. They wont say colonisation but they will find another buzzword to hide their actual feelings about the relinquishing of the pieces. \n\nThe idea that everyone in India who ever made a deal they regretted is due to colonisation is pretty racist, India had tons of rich families before, during and after British rule and those rich families act like every rich family of every race in every corner of the world. Weaponising class conciousness to get your royal grandpa's jewels back is horrible, specially with pieces of such dubious history as this necklace",

Louis Cartier had a personal archive of stuff from all over Persia, India, Russia, Japan and China (and receipts from tradesmen for the antiques in his possession) and Cartier themselves have put out a lot of info and museum exhibitions about how their designers took references from each of those cultures and reinterpreted them into the Cartier language. \n\nThe thing with all these big design houses is they all maintain pretty good archives that we can access and learn from. High Fashion is definitely bigger than just the French houses and I do think the west needs to expand beyond them but I guess I‚Äôm not ready to dismiss them entirely.

This jewellery WAS OWNED not by the jewellery maker but the person who commissioned it and PAID FOR IT. \n\nThe movie *Ocean's 8* 's necklace that is stolen off Anne Hathway?? That was a replica of an actual necklace called the Touissant Necklace, commissioned by another Indian Maharaja (of Nawanagar) in the 1930s, made by Cartier. And was owned by that Maharaja originally cos he paid for it. \n\nThis was a common process followed by royalty/rich people everywhere. Just cos it was made in France in whatever century doesn't make it owned by France . It was originally owned by the person who paid for it, simple as that. Same rules as today's times yeah ? \n\nI'm not arguing about current actual ownership of the necklace (because the necklace went missing during the British rule and changed hands multiple times probably before it was repurchased by the House of Cartier, they repurchased a lot of such jewels made by them having historical significance) , **but please atleast understand how jewellery creation happened and the rules of ownership.**",

The idea that a piece of jewelry loses its cultural connection because it was kept in India for ‚Äòonly 20 years‚Äô is deeply flawed. Many such pieces were commissioned by Indian royalty, influenced by Indian aesthetics, and carried meaning within Indian tradition before they were swallowed up by colonial systems and fetishized in European luxury circuits.\n\nTo say it‚Äôs ‚Äòjust vanity‚Äô erases how luxury and identity intersect, especially for communities who were historically excluded from these spaces. Diljit wearing that necklace, or even wanting to, isn‚Äôt some capitalist evil. It‚Äôs symbolic reclamation. He‚Äôs not exploiting culture; he‚Äôs challenging a legacy that said people like him didn‚Äôt belong in these spaces.\n\nSo maybe instead of gatekeeping who gets to access power, wealth, and style, we should be asking why it still shocks people when brown men embody those things.",

If the same trend was championed by white people they wouldn‚Äôt dislike it, put it down, use slurs against it (people calling clothes ghetto and stuff), so we need to explicitly be praising and raising up *black* fashion, not just fashion, to be working against the racists who will deride it because of that. \n\nMaybe in an alternate universe without systemic racism, racist people, or unintentional bias and privilege we could be seeing it as just fashion and not need to draw any lines between anyone, but that‚Äôs not the world we live in, so seeing those lines and appreciating and loving on our differences and coming together in them is the best way to move forwards.",

Imagine if we sorted people into races based on hair colour, it would be a lot easier for someone to sort them up and justify it if the system is already validated and in place. Words have meaning to us, and label fills functions, in this case there's nearly no benefit but a lot of harm.\n\nI have a personal anecdote from long ago, where I lived we had some people of foreign background, but they were never referred to as a different race, they were the same nationality as the rest of us regardless where their parents were from, I did not know what race was back then, no one did, but we certainly could see that they looked different, but to us it didn't matter, there was nothing to call them, they were just like us, our nationality with a slightly different skin colour.\n\nDiscimination of course existed, but racists were viewed as insane people who had separate labels for others, we knew what they meant but it made no sense to make up separate categories of people besed on their skin colour, they were in the wrong, and we still do not adhere to race, even if American culture slowly sneaks its way into ours.",

A lot of the developed world certainly eats more than is necessary. \n\nBut to get to the substance of your point, the problem is the mechanics of capitalism more than the existence of fashion itself. I agree that the largest clothing manufacturers are destroying the environment just for their bottom line (I also take issue with the human rights abuses that frequently come with their manufacture), but that's one of those things where culpability must be measured with precision. \n\nMeat production is also one of the largest pollutants, but the problem isn't the chefs - the problem is how companies like Tyson and Cargill operate. That's more of how I'm approaching this.",

It's not the event to tie into Trump's fascist bullshit to make a political statement, because there's a culturally valid reason for its existence. And yes, it does water down the analogy, because people who are into the Met Gala understand its purpose and won't see the metaphor between a fundraiser for a culturally-relevant institution that celebrates diverse history and rich people snatching up kids from poor areas to die for their entertainment.",

I'm really looking around for something to spell it out for me.\n\nI saw all the criticism first, so before I saw the interview, I imagined it went way worse. \n\nThe criticism is saying they didn't know who he was or what he was famous for, but that doesn't seem to line up with what I watched.\n\nThey introduced him by name, told the audience what he's famous for, then asked him if he was excited.\n\nThe last part is getting a lot of criticism, but I don't think that's unusual for someone really really famous. For example off the top of my head, I can think of the interview snippet in a Beyonce song where someone says \"Beyonce! Are you happy to be in Paris?!\"  -  I don't think that implies the person isn't very very famous.",

He looked amazing. \n\nBut ShahRukh deserves to have his own stand-alone post because he is freaking ShahRukh khan. He's our ShahRukh. And maybe NRIs and western audiences don't get it but we do.\n\nEdit: The original poster got mad when I said what I said. But, I stand by it. Shahrukh is a Muslim man who represented India on a global stage today. And he is loved by millions. If you don't get why that's a big deal, I cannot help you. The country has seen a rise of right-wing Islamaphobic hatred for years now. The fact SRK stands tall as a proud Muslim man and is successful and beloved is a big effing deal. And he deserves his own post. Diljit is amazing too. But this moment is about SRK and it doesn't take away any of the shine from Diljit.\n\nEdit 2- I am unable to respond to any of the attacks against my comment. So, this is my final edit. Yes, ShahRukh is a proud Indian but he is also a proud Muslim man representing India and that matters. You can act offended but literally this week a young widow who lost her husband to the Pahalgan attacks is being attacked for preaching unity between Hindus and Muslims. Whether you like or not, Muslims in India have to deal with a reality where they can be attacked, or even killed if someone suspects them of eating beef. So yes. It matters that ShahRukh is Muslim and loved by millions and if you are a Hindu and offended by it...then vote better. You can't vote for literal fascists and then cry when people point out the consequences of the fascism.",

It's nice that all of India has elected you to be in charge of this gatekeeping.\n\nEdit: **They deleted their post. I'll summarize.** They believe that no other Indian actors except Shah Rukh Khan matter and that no one else is as big of a fan of  as they are. They also don't want Diljit Dosanjh to be mentioned in this historic moment or even in the same sentence as Shah Rukh Khan. They don't want Diljit to be labeled as Indian because that's SRK's thing. However, they graciously will permit Diljit Dosanjh to be referred to as Punjabi. Most importantly, anyone who doesn't worship Shah Rukh Khan above all else is not a real Indian, but also they are better at it than everyone else and it's laughable how we don't know that.",

Literally mere days ago, Doechii was getting her flowers, people were supporting her, saying she was a breath of fresh air and what we needed in the music industry. Like genuine outpours of love. Now, off of a five second out of context clip where she briefly snapped at someone, suddenly it‚Äôs all ‚ÄúUgh I never liked her, she‚Äôs not talented enough to warrant this, she‚Äôs such a bitch, etc.‚Äù Not to be that person, but it definitely does feel like a lot of this discourse is not being had in good faith. We don‚Äôt have to get into how women are always held to much higher standards when it comes to, well, anything. Simply being a ‚Äúbitch‚Äù is enough for a woman‚Äôs whole career to be over and everyone to write her off.\n\nA lot of comments, even here, simply just reek of misogynoir. Especially the alarming amount of minimizing going on, pretending that Anxiety is ‚Äúher only hit‚Äù and that ‚Äúno one even knows who she is‚Äù as if she isn‚Äôt fresh off of a critically acclaimed mixtape that also led to her being the third black woman in history to win a Best Rap Artist Grammy. Like, be so fucking fr. People were already desperate for a reason to dislike Doechii and discredit her because her being a successful unapologetic dark skinned woman bothers people deeply, and now unfortunately because of the way she handled this those same people are now foaming at the mouth to use this as their reason.¬†\n\nI‚Äôm probably gonna get downvoted because the narrative has already been set, context/anxiety/jitters/fear or literally any nuance whatsoever missing from this five second clip be damned (and again, I am not saying that her behavior here is okay, in case you still just insist that I‚Äôm blindly defending her) But idc, I call things the way I see it and it‚Äôs incredibly disappointing to see the way that this conversation has been framed and how blatantly obvious the animosity is.",

It takes only one interaction to make a dog become reactive. \n\nMy dog was a rescue , and, in general, was  perfectly fine with other dogs at the park until one day another dog owner brought his unneutered (unknowingly to me) doodle to the park. They played very well for a few minutes until the huge doodle tried to mount my thirty-ish pound pit bull/jack terrier mix. She‚Äôs fixed, and rightfully barked, growled , and snarled to defend herself, but also, I jumped in to pull her away from him. \n\nThe owner of the doodle just laughed and then at that point told me the doodle wasn‚Äôt fixed (we live in NYC and it‚Äôs against city ordinance to have an unfixed dog in NYC dog parks üôÉüôÉ), and that he didn‚Äôt mind my dog being aggressive because it would teach his dog ‚Äúa lesson‚Äù. Meanwhile, my dog was a rescue, who has never been the same since that stupid owner‚Äôs doodle tried to mount her. It‚Äôs so hard to watch cause she loves other dogs (and wants them to chase her lol) but gets scared and triggered if a dog happens to jump on her in the middle of play.\n\nObviously, for her safety, I no longer put her in those reactive situations at the park. We are very lucky that the dog park can be separated in sections where she can get exercise by herself and I can play with her. \n\nThis is probably the most long winded post to say: be mindful of the situation you put your pups/pets in. It can only take one instance to change their behavior forever.",

I would have liked her make up to have been a bit darker too. \n\nI do like this look for the textures and style. It is very modern but does pay homage to the dandy style. \n\nHowever, it is conservative for Rihanna which i think is why many dont like it and perhaps the tight corset to emphasise the baby bump makes the proportions look weird. But I think she's had her prime of making statements with fashion and I think she's in her era where she's just enjoying it now. \n\nI do not like that her being late to the Gala is now some kind of yearly trope. There is no reason for her to be severely late and imo it is distasteful to all involved.",

        "body": "That‚Äôs a fair criticism, but the Met Gala is complicated. In times of political instability, art and self expression become so much more important. Wearable art, however, is a media that is often dismissed and diminished, considered frivolous or unimportant. You have to keep in mind that for centuries, clothing production was largely an industry run on women‚Äôs labour - but also was historically one of the few ways that women could express themselves and their personal tastes.\n\nIt‚Äôs very likely for this reason that the Met Museum‚Äôs historical costuming department is the only one that receives no funding whatsoever from the museum itself. This is why the Met Gala exists, because that is how they generate the funding they need to keep their exhibits running. We can learn so much from historical garments, and preserving them is an extremely intensive process that requires experts in the field - but those people don‚Äôt get paid without that external fundraising. \n\nSo while it is absolutely a show of opulence and wealth, it is also a grassroots effort to preserve art and history, making it available for the public to experience and learn about. \n\nThis year‚Äôs theme is particularly important as well, with clothing being a huge part of self expression and reclaiming of identity for black diaspora around the world. There are some really great video essays out there on Black Dandyism and how it grew as a movement from the 17th century to now. People whose bodies were controlled used their style as a way to defiantly reclaim those bodies, and it became a huge part of their culture. \n\nI‚Äôve already learned so much just from this year‚Äôs theme, and I probably wouldn‚Äôt have if the art of costume wasn‚Äôt being celebrated in this way each year. It‚Äôs completely fair to dislike the elitism of it all, but it‚Äôs also something that does have its roots in art and education.",

She just plays at festivals but i‚Äôm not sure how much they pay.\n\nI guess sponsorships? But so far it‚Äôs only really been H&M, Pandora, and a Stanley Cup‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt artists make the majority of their profit by touring??\n\nShe‚Äôs been global ever since water blew up almost 2 years ago, but she‚Äôs had little to show since. How do they continue to afford her if she‚Äôs not bringing in the money, attention, or fanbase like Sabrina or Chapell managed to do last year? And they keep their marketing to USA/Canada/Europe, so less expenses‚Ä¶ Tyla has gone EVERYWHERE, from brazil to japan to sweden to south korea to nigeria, that‚Äôs extremely expensive! But from what I see she‚Äôs not providing a return profit, they are really pushing her but there‚Äôs little to nothing to show for it. Her coachella performance was good, but she didn‚Äôt manage to connect to the audience well.\n\nCan someone explain how record labels work exactly? I understand it‚Äôs sort of like a loan and artists have to pay it back eventually, then they could make a profit, but Tyla isn‚Äôt showing any signs of another massive hit anytime soon, or isn‚Äôt embarking on a tour since she went on Chris Brown‚Äôs tour‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt imagine how much that loan must be‚Ä¶.\n\nShe has an upcoming collab with Shakira, but shakira‚Äôs not hitting the english market, she‚Äôs been staying within the latin market with a lot of success. She has a new single out soon I believe, ‚ÄúBliss‚Äù, but people were put off by the marketing, she performed it at Coachella but it sounds extremely boring and generic, but who knows, that‚Äôs what I thought about Espresso when it came out lol. She had her recent remix with that ‚ÄúShow Me Love‚Äù song that went viral, but her remix hasn‚Äôt performed equal or better than the original. It‚Äôs just there.\n\nSo i‚Äôm very confused about her path because she said she wants to be a global pop star and wants to be everywhere but she has to cement herself somewhere first, and while she‚Äôs cemented in amapiano South Africa, West Africa with afrobeats collabs, that‚Äôs not completely global yet. The smartest move would have been to cement herself with the black community in the US like Rihanna did and then go pop, but she fumbled with the AA community in the US‚Ä¶ idk her trajectory is so strange to me.",

Then, on the 2nd weekend, she wore a \"I'm A Slave for U\" outfit and claims she got no inspiration from Britney. I'm ranting but it's interesting to me. These new artists keep getting pushed, but it doesn't stick bc they aren't true stars.",

        "body": "Yeah, but looking at Dua she was signed on with a major record label in 2014, Tyla was signed on in 2021 I believe. Dua had her first major breakthrough with New Rules in 2017, while Tyla had her major hit in 2023. The difference though is that Dua followed up quickly with One Kiss in 2018, which was even bigger than New Rules, and followed that up with Don‚Äôt Start Now in 2019, which set off her Future Nostalgia Era. Dua was consistent in her hit output.\n\nSo tyla, we‚Äôre almost 2 years in since her last and only hit and that has been no huge hit follow up, she only has Water. She hasn‚Äôt been consistent, Jump almost had a moment, Push 2 Start performed better but it‚Äôs not a hit. She‚Äôs underperforming the pop girls that are performing well, hit after hit like Sabrina and Chapell. Her and Tate are just not resonating well. She should have some sort of follow-up hit by now if she wanted to be that global superstar, the general audience‚Äôs attention span is very low, especially now, and currently Sabrina and Chapell have those main pop girl status slots. \n\nDua was also touring from 2017-2018, performing at festivals and award shows. That era of hers was consistent, although she was memed, you can‚Äôt take away that huge success she had. Tyla is nowhere near Dua‚Äôs hit singles from 2017-2019, also in that 2 year span. Dua took a little longer to break through, but she‚Äôs had long term growth. I see that Tyla took off fast, but perhaps that could be a detriment to her long term growth. People don‚Äôt know her for being Tyla, they know her as being the water singer. By the time One Kiss came out, people didn‚Äôt see Dua as the ‚ÄúOne Kiss‚Äù or ‚ÄúNew Rules‚Äù singer, they saw her as Dua Lipa. Water overpowered Tyla.\n\nShe‚Äôs absolutely underperforming and the sudden increase in her sponsorships show that her label obviously knows this.",

Even with P2S only peaking in the late 80s on the chart it‚Äôs still higher than other artists from the continent, which makes it significant. I agree that she should have toured but despite not touring her momentum hasn‚Äôt died off entirely like other artists would have, and a lot of significant people in the industry want to or have collaborated with her like Shakira.\n\nI find her career to be kind of very random in the sense that it could go completely any way and some of the moves she makes do not make sense. I feel like she‚Äôs at times known more for fashion and her general image than music, considering she has more followers on insta than people like Tate and Chappell but less streams than them. I do agree that she definitely has a benefactor in the industry that loves her very much and wants her to succeed (Sylvia Rhone) but I feel like the biggest hindrance to that may be her fans. It‚Äôll be interesting to see her career in the next coming years. A lot of people think she‚Äôll fall off but I feel like she goes viral so easily, she might be the chosen one for music from the continent so lets see.",

I fear the photos do not do it justice. Whoever made that is a genius. \n\nA$AP's look doesn't compel me at all. \n\nFor me it is Colman by a mile, with Pharrell second for the beads.

In fact, she paid off her mom's mortgage several months ago and most recently bought herself a 1.3 Million dollar home.\n\n\n2. While invitees do have to contribute 75K to the Met charity, Angel was not simply invited and and having fun for a night out. She was literally on the Met Gala Host Committee; it was her job to be there.\n\n3. She, a member of the Met Gala Host Committee, is wearing custom made Thom Browne. It was designed for her and I doubt she had to pay for it.",

And since the song art is new (after George Floyd),[ I think it represents him and Garner.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DOECHII/comments/1k2l2ku/anxiety_original_song_art_it_forms_two_halves_of/) That's why the scar is so big and crosses her jugular, lethal looking.\n\nThe LV brand is a way of reclaiming it. Just as the book talks about how black dandyism itself originated in slavery, masters dressing up their house slaves. Yet it became an outlet for self-expression and public creativity for free (not slave) black men during unfree times.\n\nPartly, it's a nod to things like Fenty Beauty. A black woman making more shades of makeup for all, after centuries of makeup. As well as black designers like Pharrell. I actually think it's intentionally provocative\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jrl7370lc3ze1.jpeg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=22e3cbfe59be94e21c7276733d433bccce8a95ff",

I think he'll be given time to develop, like some other designers at LVMH.\n\nI also think her outfit is the only nod to Dapper Dan in the show\n\nOf course, it would be better if she just straight up talked about the concept behind Anxiety, etc.\n\nThe face logo reminds me of Kendrick's crown of thorns.

That creates a very narrow Venn diagram, since the song was written in 2019 and excludes most other incidents.\n\nHer lyrics show the consistent story progression:\n\n* **tryna silence me**\n* Somebody's watchin' me and my anxiety,\n* oh, I feel it tryin‚Äô\n* **oh, I**¬†***feel***¬†**the silence**\n* oh,¬†**somebody's touchin' me**\n* oh, I feel it tryin' (It's my anxiety, can't let it¬†**conquer**¬†me)\n* oh, I¬†**feel**¬†the silence\n* Negro run from po-po\n* I get this¬†**tightness in my chest**\n* Like an¬†**elephant is standing on me**\n* **can‚Äôt shake it off of me**\n* (It keeps on tryin')\n* gotta keep it off of me (Can't shake it off of me)\n\nObviously, it works at the literal level of anxiety. But then, why does she mention the \"popo\"? How does \"money on my jugular\" fit? The Garner subtext is why the end of the story is a losing struggle.\n\n**\"Court order Florida\"** in this context means the acquittal of Trayvon Martin's killer. There's no other national news incident of racial profiling in Florida.\n\nThe Anxiety art immediately brings to mind ABNH, but I never knew it was part of that photoshoot. [I see what you're talking about now](https://stupiddope.com/2024/08/doechii-unveils-tracklist-for-upcoming-album-alligator-bites-never-heal/), thanks! But I do think that she chose the song art to be an edit with two of her with that scar in order to fit.\n\nI do think that the new art is alluding to police brutality. Even if it's a different angle of an unrelated scene in the MV.\n\nRegardless, the lyrics themselves draw deep into Eric Garner and Trayvon Martin's situation. The 2nd verse is actually a comparison of Democrats to Republicans. Garner died in a Democrat (blue) state.\n\nDid you catch that \"elephant\" is refers to Republicans?",

So the art exhibit is ‚ÄúSuperfine: Tailoring Black Style‚Äù and the gala is ‚ÄúTailored for You.‚Äù I‚Äôm not sure where they got menswear from. There was this quote:\n\nAndrew Bolton, Curator in Charge, The Costume Institute, commented: ‚ÄúOver the last few years, menswear has undergone somewhat of a Renaissance. At the vanguard of this revitalization is a group of extremely talented Black designers who are constantly challenging normative categories of identity. While their styles are both singular and distinctive, what unites them is a reliance on various tropes that are rooted in the tradition of dandyism, and specifically Black dandyism. It was this observation that led me to research the Black dandy‚Äôs origins and, ultimately, to Monica‚Äôs pioneering work on the subject. In her role as guest curator, Monica visualizes the history of Black dandyism through a wide range of objects and invites us to explore the figure of the Black dandy as much as an idea as an identity.‚Äù\n\nSo the curator in charge was inspired by menswear to delve into dandyism.¬†\n\nhttps://www.metmuseum.org/press-releases/superfine-2025-exhibitions\n\nI think it‚Äôs a really cool theme tbh.¬†",

Anyway if anyone wants tips(and I hope you take this, use it responsibly and only think it-not post it especially cause this can be a side effect of other things/the person could‚Äôve just lost the baby etc):look at the face. Pregnant people very quickly get an increased fluid volume in their body. FTR you‚Äôre not looking at whether someone looks ‚Äúbigger‚Äù or has put on weight. Just whether they seem to have more fluid to their face. It‚Äôs easy to tell with celebrities you don‚Äôt see everyday. It‚Äôs much more tough on ppl you see regularly in person.",

So there‚Äôs that. But just digging even slightly deeper the well of references the outfit it hitting‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs basically a reimagined Zoot suit which was a hallmark of black men‚Äôs fashion in the late 1930s and 40s. While the zoot suit did spread to other minority communities (Mexican Americans were also famous for wearing them) they became a political statement of counter cultural expression to the point where they became a cultural firebrand. They were like the low hanging saggy jeans showing off your boxers and making the establishment rage of their day. The zoot suit was the center of the Zoot Suit Riots where white servicemen during WWII attacked and stripped Mexican American youths wearing them for being ‚Äúunpatriotic‚Äù (the argument being that the suits took up too much fabric) during rationing. \n\nSo it‚Äôs immediately a political statement and one that returns to the idea of historical black excellence. \n\nThen the chains, the durag, the shoes‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs so many references so artfully put together I think I‚Äôm missing more than I‚Äôm picking up. \n\nIt‚Äôs a masterful outfit. Like the kind of thing you could put on display and talk about as an entire illustration of black fashion history. It‚Äôs sheer perfection and the night has barely begun!",

    "selftext": "I posted a version of this thread last year and people seemed to like it, so here's an updated version:\n\nHooray, it's the first Monday in May! There are a lot of misconceptions about the Met Gala so let's talk about it in advance of tonight's coverage.\n\nFirst, it‚Äôs a fundraising event to raise money for a non-profit, the Met‚Äôs Costume Institute, not a random fancy-dress ball.\n\nSecondly, the ‚Äútheme‚Äù is the subject of that year‚Äôs special exhibition. Calls to ‚Äújust change the theme‚Äù a few weeks before the event because it‚Äôs controversial, like ‚ÄúKarl Lagerfield: A Line of Beauty,‚Äù are strange because museum exhibits are planned months to years in advance. There would be no feasible way to just have a different exhibition at the last minute.\n\nThirdly, speaking of themes, there is no requirement for attendees to dress to match the subject of the exhibition, only the dress code. Many do, because it‚Äôs fun and good press, but the regular ‚Äúit‚Äôs great but they don‚Äôt match the theme ‚òπÔ∏è‚Äù discourse after every Met Gala is pretty silly. \n\nThis is especially relevant this year because the exhibit is \"Superfine: Tailoring Black Style\" but the dress code is \"Tailored for You.\" I'm guessing most non-POC attendees won't wear outfits inspired by black fashion (maybe because of the risk of cultural appropriation) but instead might wear nicely tailored pieces. \n\nLastly, most celebrities who attend the Met Gala are guests of the invited designers/fashion houses. Some do buy their own ticket, which costs thousands of dollars, but they‚Äôre a minority. Therefore, if Margot Robbie is a guest of Chanel, then she has to wear Chanel. This also impacts the ‚Äúfollowing the theme‚Äù aspect - e.g. the celebrity guests for Moschino looked great at the ‚ÄúCamp: Notes on Fashion‚Äù gala but, unsurprisingly, looked less great at the ‚ÄúChina: Through the Looking Glass‚Äù gala. I anticipate that brands that typically haven't drawn much inspiration from black style won't suddenly choose to do so tonight.\n\nSo, I love fashion, and love how much discussion the Met Gala generates. It‚Äôs like the red carpet Olympics, but the overexposure plus lack of understanding leads to a lot of dis- and misinformation. I hope this overview is useful. ",

It‚Äôs kind of led to a dumbing down of the event IMO\n\nAlso, inevitably when someone mentions that they don‚Äôt like the more OTT or on the nose looks, someone else will come along and be like, ‚Äúwell too bad, it‚Äôs a fundraiser for the **Costume** Institute.‚Äù They‚Äôre just completely unaware that the word ‚Äòcostume‚Äô has multiple meanings.

Is it a venue where designers like have fun creating and showcasing standalone looks that are risky/larger than life/almost-definitely-polarizing-cuz-art/whatever (rather than costume tho)? In contrast to runway (where everything is part of a collection) or a red carpet (driven by the wearer and what ‚Äúlooks good‚Äù).\nAnd a kinda part 2 to that question: they invite people who they want to dress largely because they fit a creative vision and/or are someone they want to work with the create something cool?\nThat‚Äôs what I‚Äôve always thought of it as with the theme being something interwoven into it to whatever degree they choose. Even with a strictly ‚Äúrequired‚Äù theme, one could make up a convincing reason that anything fits a theme, especially if the context is that your a world renowned creative.\nOr do most not think of it like that at all? \n\n2. I know the celebs are invited by the designers and most aren‚Äôt paying for a ticket. But didn‚Äôt realize it was PRIMARILY a fundraising event. Who is paying then? \nIt‚Äôd be really surprising to me to learn that designers/fashion houses are the best group of people to be funding something where money is the goal. Also struggling with the idea that like.. law roach is paying for zendayas ticket lol.\nAre there a bunch of random rich people there in outfits that fit them well that we don‚Äôt know or care to know about that are what the Met Gala actually is?\n\n3. People keep following ‚Äúthe theme isn‚Äôt required‚Äù with ‚Äúthe dress code was tailored for you.‚Äù What have other dress codes been? Are they all kinda‚Ä¶ like that?\nPersonally, I‚Äôm struggling to understand ‚Äútailored for you‚Äù as a meaningful descriptor. At an event where a designer chooses a person and dresses them in something they designed, tailoring it for them is like the most heavily implied, basic, does not need to be mentioned‚Ä¶ task‚Ä¶ that everyone will do no matter what the theme or dress code are, if a theme or code exist, what the actual purpose of the event is, or literally anything at all. And Im pretty confident I‚Äôm going to so more curious about what other dress codes have been than an explanation of this one.\n\nI‚Äôm so so genuinely curious lmao",
