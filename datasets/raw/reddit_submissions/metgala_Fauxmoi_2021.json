Are some of the dresses donated to the Met?\n\nAnd agree about people putting messages on dresses. I watched the Vogue livestream and I might be remembering it wrong but I believe AOC said she was wearing a dress from a \"working class immigrant WOC.\" The dress was designed by a woman who lives in Toronto who is the girlfriend of the heir of a family worth billions which is quite different than a first generation immigrant woman from Mexico living in LA struggling to start her own company while working at her middle class family's restaurant or something similar to that.

Given that the usual idea of the middle class involves owning their own home (an actual house with a lawn, not a condo) in a nice neighborhood (meaning where the other people living there make about the same amount of money), being able to take a vacation out of town once a year or so, send your kids to college, etc., and given the price of real estate these days in both DC and NYC, she's definitely not making enough money to be considered rich.  (The average income where I live right now is about $75K/year, and people with combined 6-figure incomes I know are still trying to figure out how they can actually buy a house and not keep renting without moving way out into the outer burbs.)  Honestly, at this point \"rich\" doesn't even include anyone who's worth $1 million or so--rich in comparison to the average person, yes, but not when you look at what people in the supposed \"middle class\" are making.  What's even stranger is thinking of, say, film or music people worth $20 million or so; compared to the Gates and Bezos of the world, or people with slightly less money but who are involved in international business of some kind, $20 million is practically pocket change.  It's all in where you're coming from and your particular perspective.\n\n(I knew I was raised rural working class--although we always thought of ourselves as middle class when I was a kid, because my parents owned their house and kept us fed and clothed on my dad's very modest salary--but I didn't recognize just how different I was from a lot of my current \"middle class\" friends and acquaintances until one of them scoffed at my never having been overseas--\"*Everyone's* been to Europe!\"  Um, no, a lot of us couldn't afford to; we also didn't go to private colleges or have a lot of other advantages, either.  Feel like paying for my trip to the UK/Ireland someday?  I didn't grow up in a comfortable East Coast suburb, with lots of trips to the city on a regular basis; going to, say, an art museum was maybe a once-a-year field trip treat, not something you could do on any old weekend.

She immediately started out with the biggest brands and befriended Karl Lagerfeld and Anna Wintour. Nepo models like her (and Kendall and Kaia) show up to castings after their fam makes a call.

In this day and age, \"subtle\" doesn't cut it, and perhaps it never did; these days, you all but have to smack someone over the head with a 2x4 just to get their attention, never mind make them actually *think* about something. As far as I'm concerned, if you have a cause about which you feel that strongly, and you somehow end up with a platform that allows you to get your message out to the largest number of people possible, then, by God, USE IT.  Yes, maybe Joaquin Phoenix talking about veganism and cows being abused while holding his Oscar was a tad cringey, but you know what?  He had the opportunity to hold forth on a subject about which he felt passionately, and he grabbed that opportunity by the balls and *took it*. (Or perhaps I should say \"by the udders?\")  Everyone always pisses and moans when something like that happens, but *I. fucking. LOVE. IT.*  It's launching a grenade into the crowd to see who's actually paying attention to what's going down, but the grenade is a paint ball instead; nobody gets hurt, and the point gets made.  So what if a few people complain or need to spend a bit more money on dry-cleaning?   There's no way to make your point or advertise your cause without someone complaining, because when you get down to it, no one really wants things to change if said change might make them uncomfortable.  You're damned if you do and damned if you don't, so go ahead and splash that paint around, and get your message out! \n\n(Now personally, I think Cara's outfit was just plain tacky, but hey, if Dior was willing to make it, and her to wear it...although the idea that she ripped off someone else bothers me a lot more than her doing it in the first place.)",

        "body": "And *some* people have no idea how much it costs to live in or near a major coastal city--it's a hell of a lot more expensive to live in Boston/NYC/DC/San Francisco/Seattle/LA than it is pretty much anywhere in the heartland.  Even in areas that aren't as pricey, cities and inner suburbs are always a lot more expensive than the surrounding area, unless the latter is a college town, which also tends to run more expensive for reasons I shouldn't have to explain.  \n\nYes, $50K a year for me might feel almost rich, but I know what the median income in my city is ($75K), and I know how much everything costs around here; \"middle class\" implies that you can afford your own home, and there is NO way on God's green earth that I could ever do that here on $50K/year.  I also know I have $78K in student loans I'll be paying back for the rest of my life, which I had to take on in order to get the education that allows me to \"pass\" for middle class and call myself a \"professional\", and that many doctors, attorneys, and other professionals whose jobs require advanced degree often have student loan in the 6-figure range, sometimes even mid-6-figures. If your parents aren't at least low-level millionaires, you're going to *have* to take out student loans, particularly if you go to the \"big name\" schools that one needs on one's resume to get anywhere--when I moved to the Boston area, I found out my little BA from a small state college wasn't worth jack shit in the wider world, whereas people with degrees from the Ivy League or well-known private colleges pretty much had the red carpet rolled out for them. A bachelor's degree now is the high school diploma of 50 years ago in that you need one to be hired for all but the most menial positions, and preferably that degree is from a school everyone's heard of, or it still may not count.  (Anyone who starts in with the whole \"but you didn't NEED to take out loans/go to grad school\" bullshit will get metaphorically bitchslapped upside the head, so *don't even go there*. The whole business of needing an advanced degree to count as a \"professional\" is a whole 'nother argument, and not one I feel like having tonight.)\n\n$175K may *seem* rich, depending on where you live and how much you might be making, but I assure you--at this point in time in much of the US, it's *only* middle class, and in many places, *lower* middle class at that. AOC with her Congressional salary is NOT the enemy, and she damn sure isn't *rich*.  *She's* not the person you should be going after; those people would be folks like the Walton family, or Bezos, or Zuckerberg, or any number of other individuals whose wealth is counted in billions, not millions.  THOSE are the \"rich\" she's referring to, THOSE are the people who want you to obsess about AOC and her $175K so you don't pay attention to their billions, and THOSE are the people who need to start paying their fucking taxes, got it?",

My personal opinion is that Anna Wintour is trying insanely hard to make it relevant to Gen Z by inviting TikTokers, having Billie Eilish and Timothee Chalamet co-chair, etc. Her ultimate goal is to save her job and lord it over the next generation of wannabes like she has since the ‚Äò80s, but I don‚Äôt think her attempts will get her anywhere in the end. She‚Äôll still be pushed out of Vogue and the Gala will be much less of a big-deal Hollywood event in the future than it was in the 2010s. (NYFW has trended in that direction too, FWIW, with it becoming increasingly less relevant to the industry as a preview event and more a place to be seen for Instagrammers and TikTokers.) \n\nZendaya is a huge star in the target age range and I feel like she‚Äôs been on everyone‚Äôs minds lately, especially after she crushed the Dune red carpet. Of course there are huge stars who skip the Met Gala every year, but Zendaya not making the time to attend isn‚Äôt a good look for the event, especially since she‚Äôs made time to attend other high profile events while Euphoria is filming.",

Designers get invited by Vogue and their guest is usually a celeb/model who is wearing their design. If i‚Äôm not mistaken, the Met used to sell tickets to the gala for around $50-100k (it‚Äôs a fundraiser) and that‚Äôs how one would bypass the Vogue-Invite rule. \n\nI think because of the popularity that the Gala has gained in the last few years, there has been a decline in the prestige‚Äî meaning it‚Äôs just become more accessible to famous people (because they are more likely to be able to afford to come without being invited by a designer). When people talk about ‚ÄúThe Prestige‚Äù coming back to the 2021 Met Gala, i feel like  it‚Äôs moreso focused on designers getting a limited number guests and less tickets being sold by the museum (and for higher prices) +++ the timing with Fashion Week and other COVID travel restrictions/rules. I bet lots of familiar faces will be absent this year due to other commitments in the fashion world, designers being from other countries, and celebs/models unwilling to get vaxxed.",

A fashion copycat isn't really camp unless maybe it is intentional parody in some way.\n\n3) I didn't not say she was off theme, I said it was weak, which it was.  The Joan of Arc for religious iconography was better, but still something of a safer choice for which she was heaped praise. She stands out as slightly better in a sea of vastly boring that young Hollywood has become,  but I will always ask for more. I'm sorry to lightly criticize someone you quite obviously like, but rich people's fashion exists to be criticize and you don't actually know her.

I know generations don‚Äôt have an exact start/end date, but nearly everything I‚Äôve read classifies Gen Z as beginning in 1997, or very occasionally 1996. Timothee Chalamet  was born in 1995 (albeit the very end of 1995, but still‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs ‚Äò95). By most accounts he‚Äôs classified as a millennial. So WHY is he almost exclusively referred to as part of Gen Z??  ‚ÄúZillennial/Cusper‚Äù I would at least understand, but generally speaking he shouldn‚Äôt be called Gen Z.  \n\n\nAs someone born in ‚Äò94 who‚Äôs desperately clinging to my youth, I‚Äôm mostly just jealous that people consider him part of the younger generation even though he‚Äôs technically a millennial, too.",
