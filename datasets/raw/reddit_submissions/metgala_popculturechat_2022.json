    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI hope this is allowed here. I tried to ask the Blake Lively subreddit but it got deleted.\n\nI have been working from home for the last 2 years, and have never met most of my coworkers. I sometimes make mistakes at work and have a hard time connecting with people over zoom so I've been feeling very isolated. A few months ago, one coworker said she was obsessed with Blake Lively, and without thinking, I said I was too. I do not know anything about Blake Lively.\n\nShe talked about her for a little bit, I responded enthusiastically and we actually had a chat! She hasn't brought it up again, but everyone has been nicer to me since then. I thought I was in the clear.\n\nTomorrow we are having a work party, and I will be meeting my coworkers for the first time in person. I was looking forward to it, but then on a zoom call just now my coworker said she can't wait to talk about Blake Lively tomorrow. With me. A fellow Blake Lively superfan.\n\nIf I had known earlier, I would have done Blake Lively research, but it is last minute, and when I google 'Blake Lively facts' it's just stuff like she's a virgo. I don't think dropping that she's a virgo \\[August 25th, 1987\\] into conversation will make me look normal.\n\nDo you guys have any fun anecdotes or stories about Blake Lively that I can read and put into a conversation with my coworkers that make me sound someone who is a Blake Lively Fan? As an example, my coworker said that Taylor Swift announced Blake Lively's baby names in an album and they are best friends, and she will probably announce the next baby that Blake Lively will have too. I know a couple things about Taylor Swift, but I don't think it'll work as a conversational life raft.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT:** Thank you all so much again for your kindness and help! The party went well last night. At work our departments are pretty insular, so I had no idea how many coworkers I actually had. Which meant I spent a lot less time talking with the specific coworker than I had expected, so I only got to bust out one Blake Lively fact *\\[It's so cool that she's her own designer and I love how she matches the carpet at the Met Gala!\\]* \n\nI have not come clean on my Blake Lively Fraud, and at this point I know so much about her that I'm not sure if it's still even fraud. But, while I may have been overthinking the party, it seems like as long as I continue to work here, I'm going to be talking about Blake Lively from time to time. So in a way, you all generously donated a specific occupational training course to me. I should get a Certificate In Blake Lively. You guys are the best.",

        "body": "The grown up part of my brain says this is a terrible idea and I should be advising you to just say you didn‚Äôt mean to say you were such a fan but what the hell, here‚Äôs everything I can think of about Blake Lively (admittedly not a super fan):\n\n-she always wears beautiful, on-theme gowns to the met gala (recently fans on social media realized that her gowns often match the red carpet at the gala, suggesting she has insider knowledge). Google her met gala dresses through the years, and watch the video of the Statue of Liberty gown transformation from earlier this year.\n\n-she is well known for her sense of style despite not employing a stylist. She has great relationships with fashion designers. Check out her style during promo for the movie she did with Anna Kendrick (and the character‚Äôs style in the movie, especially the blue pinstripe waistcoat/pants look that Taylor copied recently)\n\n-she directed Taylor‚Äôs music video for I Bet You Think About Me. You should check that out. I also think there‚Äôs a behind the scenes video of her directing it or something like that on YouTube\n\n-she and her husband Ryan Reynolds are well known for their tweets about/at each other- you can find them on twitter. Online gossip folks say that it‚Äôs all PR and people write their tweets for them to make them seem like the perfect couple that‚Äôs in love and makes fun of each other \n\n-I feel like Jimmy Fallon might have a crush on her? She‚Äôs on his show a lot. Also her toddler daughter is super into Jimmy Fallon (you can look up the clip where she‚Äôs on his show and shows a video of the daughter with a Jimmy Fallon cardboard cutout)\n\n-some folks say that her relationship with Ryan Reynolds is the cutest ever, others say he‚Äôs controlling and doesn‚Äôt want his wife to work \n\n-the daughters ‚ÄúJames‚Äù ‚Äúbetty‚Äù and ‚ÄúInez‚Äù are named in Taylor Swift‚Äôs song ‚Äúbetty‚Äù on her folklore album. There is some speculation that the unborn child that she is currently pregnant with will be named ‚ÄúDaisy‚Äù or ‚ÄúDaisy Mae‚Äù because the name is used in Taylor‚Äôs latest album, but I think that‚Äôs unlikely \n\n-I honestly didn‚Äôt think I knew this many things about Blake Lively.\n\n-she dated Leonardo DiCaprio for a bit. I think this was when he was in his 30s so it wasn‚Äôt weird yet that he only dates women under 25\n\n-she is best known for playing Serena Van Der Woodsen on Gossip Girl. I think Leighton Meester (her costar who played Blair) honestly was more talented but Blake is far more famous: I think this is because of her undeniable beauty and her relationship with Ryan.\n\n-she and Ryan got married on a plantation in 2013 which is seriously icky\n\nI‚Äôll edit and add more items as I think of them. PLEASE update me how it goes lol. I‚Äôm invested now.\n\nSincerely though, whether or not you come clean about Blake, I wish you the best of luck with your coworker!! Making friends at work can be tough even when in person in the best of times\n\nLol should I be ashamed of knowing this much about Blake Lively? The only think I even watched her in was the Anna Kendrick movie i don‚Äôt know the name of and Gossip Girl back in high school.",

You don‚Äôt need to pretend to have seen/know everything. People use ‚Äúsuperfan/obsessed‚Äù differently, you could easily just say yea I love her fashion and think she seems really cool and funny on social media but I haven‚Äôt actually seen many of her films/only became aware of her a couple of years ago.\n\nPeople love teaching others about their obsessions so let the lack of knowledge in a certain area/being a new fan work in your favour to get the other person talking and the attention off you(re lack of knowledge). ETA: easy to say ‚Äúyeah I love her on social media, it‚Äôs so weird I haven‚Äôt watched any of her stuff! What‚Äôs your best rec?‚Äù\n\nMost importantly pick something that you ARE a fan of/knowledgeable about to pivot to so you can make some other genuine connections and share your interests.

She is also married to Ryan Reynolds, a beloved actor and comedian, and honestly they have maybe been the biggest power couple in the celebrity world for a while now.At least to me.\n\nPpl who don‚Äôt care abt fashion or pop culture would still maybe know her as an actress. She was in the movie Shallows which is a great movie. She was in Green Lantern which isn‚Äôt as great a movie but it‚Äôs how she met Ryan Reynolds so that‚Äôs cute. And she was the star of Gossip Girl and pretty much drove the show to success. She‚Äôs generally funny and comes up in pop culture often, but if you really want to connect more with this coworker maybe try watching the original Gossip Girl show and ask her if she‚Äôs into it.

(At least in terms of getting along.)\n\nI believe she grew up evangelical Christian (I think he only became one in his late teens/early twenties?) and that way of growing up doesn‚Äôt exactly prepare you for a healthy, 21st-century marriage. It‚Äôs not uncommon to hear prayer requests from young evangelical married couples that go, ‚Äúplease pray for us! Marriage is SO hard and it‚Äôs the hardest thing we‚Äôve ever done! We don‚Äôt want to say any more, for privacy‚Äôs sake, but we need your prayers, brothers and sisters!‚Äù (This might come from as early as >one year of marriage.)\n\nIt‚Äôs really sad. As an older exvangelical Christian, I worry for young people like her (and him, though he‚Äôs older). Purity culture never helped with any of this, either.",
