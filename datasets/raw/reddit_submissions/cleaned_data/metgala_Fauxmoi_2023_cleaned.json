I remember back during the Johnny Derp trial she never once weighed in on it, and some people noticed. She was asked to comment and kept brushing it aside saying it’s unfair to expect her to be across every issue. I found that hard to swallow as it was arguably the biggest issue to consume social media in the last few years. It was a watershed moment which has seen an increase in defamation lawsuits globally as abusers are now emboldened to manipulate the court systems to further abuse their victims. It has had, and will continue to have, huge knock on effects for women and anyone who’s been a victim of abuse at the hands of powerful men. It made no sense that she didn’t weigh in…. Unless of course it had something to do with her new Marvel role, and being on Disney payroll. I think for the most part she is well intentioned. And she could have just taken aim at Karl Lagerfeld, but she didn’t, she is specifically calling out the double standards of people who appear to champion good causes but then manage to put their morals aside for fame, money or a seat at the table. If she hadn’t taken that angle, I wouldn’t care so much, but she did and so I believe she is hypocritical. Honestly, there is no squeaky clean version of a Hollywood career. If you work in Hollywood then at some point you’ve turned a blind eye to the inequitable systems in place, the exploitation of others, the rubbing shoulders with literal abusers. If she must have such an “all or nothing” standard for other activists then she should lead by example, ditch the TV career and throw everything she’s got into her activism. I’d have mad respect for her if she did that.",

Jameela’s longterm boyfriend (no idea if they’re still together) confirmed that she’d battled cervical cancer twice (and it’s one of the cancers with the highest recurrence rates) so I guess James Blake is lying too. It’s crazy how y’all take those Morrissey “receipts” as gospel when she’s financially profiting from ‘exposing’ Jameel, someone who was already widely disliked and thought of as annoying before the Munchausen nonsense started. There’s a reason Morrisey wasn’t able to get another job after Vice.\n\nThe rest of it is all just the same white lies every celeb tells to be cool add quirky. EDS causes many other conditions (including food sensitivities/intolerances that some laypeople may call “allergies”, hearing loss, and gut issues). There’s a reason many disabled groups defended and continue to defend Jameela. And what? Do you think it’s impossible for her to have been in a car accident or broken bones? She has to be lying about those too?  And before you go saying the EDS is fake too, here is a video of her [demonstrating some of the symptoms](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMYKfBMdu/) and receiving love and support form others with EDS in the comments. As someone who’s young and conventionally attractive with a disability but doesn’t “look” disabled, what I’m sick of is people invalidating and belittling women’s lived experiences, especially those of us with chronic illnesses. These diseases are *comorbid*, meaning that someone who has one is more likely to also have others. We are constantly gaslit by doctors, our families, and society at large that we *must* be faking or lying or crazy, especially if we are able to hold jobs and ‘look’ abled bodied. Congratulations on contributing to the millenia-old trope of calling any woman whose life experiences doesn’t meet your narrow views a “liar” based on some instagram “”””receipts””” from an unemployed ex Vice editor who has never met Jameela in person and built her public platform from people’s desire to tear down ‘annoying’ women every day.",

Yes, we weren’t directly celebrating Karl ourselves, but we were watching (and therefore tacitly endorsing the theme). How can we sit here condemning how pervasive misogyny is in Hollywood, condemning the people who said nothing about Weinstein or signed that Polanski letter, yet support a gala thrown in honour of a someone who would’ve defended both and was unapologetically an islamophobic/fatphobic/misogynistic/r*pe apologist? All that tells Hollywood and the fashion industry is that as long as an event has our favourite celebrities in pretty dresses and nice suits we will put aside our morals and watch anyway.\n\nEdit. And the met gala is an optional event for us, none of us *needed* to watch, so I don’t know why people are comparing it to her job, and saying that she’s just as bad for working with Disney. Try to find a movie/tv studio that *isn’t* problematic. That still isn’t the same as us watching an event none of us are obligated to watch and wouldn’t affect us if we skipped.

But you don't get to walk past striking laborers in runway couture, kiss the organizers' asses, and then still act like it's this brilliant, subversive thing to accept a $10K seat at the table at a gala for the arts, AND expect me to applaud you for still sitting your ass down & enjoying the catering.\n\nSure, the double standard Jamil is pointing out exists, but there's no actual win here. Karl was in many ways repugnant. Jameela's not wrong. But he's also already dead. And Jameela herself \"went along to get along\" when that Disney cash & having to endure the potential backlash from Depp stans were what was at stake, because the consequences of choosing otherwise would have impacted her personally, professionally, and financially.

Although she’s known for her diverse roles from films like “The Help,” “Zero Dark Thirty,” “The Eyes of Tammy Faye,” and many more, very little is known about her private life other than what she’s shared with the world.\nShe met her husband Gian Luca Pasi De Preposulo in 2012 and they married in 2017. It wasn’t until 2020 when pictures surfaced online of the two of them walking around Santa Monica, CA that we found out they were parents of two children that they had through surrogate. It has also been reported (although just rumor at this point) that they had a third child, also through surrogate.\nSo it is without question that Jessica Chastain still keeps her personal life extremely private & out of the public eye. However, eagle eyed viewers on social media have noticed a trend with her lately as she has been photographed both at events and at random locations in New York City, Los Angeles, and even overseas, not wearing her wedding band. now one could assume that there is nothing behind that but an argument could be made that her and her husband may be separated and or divorced, and because she keeps her personal life so private, no one can really know for sure. But but a picture is worth 1000 words, so I leave it up to you all to figure it out for yourselves. What do you all think?",

Temporary toners are super cheap and very gentle on the hair, great for experimenting with this to find what suits if you do decide to bleach and don't like the platinum!

The Met has impressive collections (and the ability to borrow pieces) but I've been more impressed with the V&A and other exhibits around NY (e.g. Brooklyn Museum, Museum of FIT, MAD) where it seems like the curators put in more effort to educate and show appreciation for the work even if they don't have a showy location for their displays. I've been kicking myself for skipping the recent Dior show.",

Barbie and Ken also have a good friendship, and it there is no overly \"romantic,\" obsessing about a guy thing that plagues most of the media directed at girls and women.\n\nPete is a shitty guy imo. He has mistreated and used women in the past. But, his \"goofyness\" and bde lets him get away with a lot.\n\nTrigger Warning, he jokes about CSA.\nI have linked an excerpt from the article. It is disgusting and disturbing. There is nothing funny about CSA. This joke was made only a few years ago, at a high point in his career.\n\nhttps://canoe.com/entertainment/celebrity/pete-davidsons-baby-sex-joke-at-standup-gig-shocks-crowd\n\n\"Pete Davidson is telling joke after inappropriate joke — but not everyone is laughing.\n\nOn Monday at his comedy event, Pete Davidson And Friends, the funnyman shocked and even angered the crowd with his controversial stories about baby sex and people with disabilities.\n\nOne of his most scandalous routines included a story about how he was babysitting his friend’s child, and the baby, who is teething, began sucking on his finger “but good,” he said.\n\n“I don’t want to f— this baby but he’s asking for it,” he said, adding that he doesn’t want to have sex with any babies, but if he did, he would choose that one.\n\nDavidson, 25, whose show took place at The Bell House in Brooklyn, New York, then did an entire routine using the expression “mentally retarded” and saying how funny it was.\n\n“People wonder why…people are retarded… Oh I said ‘retarded,’ I don’t care!” he said.\n\nThe star also got slammed for repeatedly saying how much he despises people.\n\n“I f—ing hate everyone so much,” he said.\"",

Anna Wintour acts as a facilitator and a mediator bringing the museum and Vogue together to create the gala. She doesn’t choose the theme as it is chosen by the Met and the exhibition they are highlighting on a certain year.

Edit: after watching again, Chloe held the microphone in front of Stella after Aubrey said “sustainable stella” and it seems like stella just felt she needed to say something because the Chloe held the mi in front of her?\n\nI think all of them were just chatting/joking while the coverage was elsewhere (I think this is where the joke with Aubrey’s last name came from) and the switch to the interview just did not go smoothly.\n\nHowever almost all of the interviews were incredibly awkward, the hosts taking over each other or the interviewee, some technical issues(?) that made the changes between different segments awkward, just all in all quite cringe.",

I think Kourt is done with the family business but can't leave contractually cuz her mom Kris won't let her. To her credit, Kourt and Scott did carry the show in the early years cuz Kim didn't want to film (and often times didn't). Kris never seemed to lean into Kim to do the show either at that time. \n\nAnyhow, Kim is Kris's favorite and that's always put her at odds with Kourt. There's a bit of misdirected anger from Kourt towards Kim over this (and some stuff that Kim's rightly done like slap the shit out of her). \n\nI don't watch the show anymore and haven't for years. But I really do wish Kourt would just STFU, live her life and let the chips fall. Her family is full of big girls. They'll figure it out.",
