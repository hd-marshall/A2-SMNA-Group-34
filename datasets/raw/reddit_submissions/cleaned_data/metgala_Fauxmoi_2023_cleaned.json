I remember back during the Johnny Derp trial she never once weighed in on it, and some people noticed. She was asked to comment and kept brushing it aside saying it‚Äôs unfair to expect her to be across every issue. I found that hard to swallow as it was arguably the biggest issue to consume social media in the last few years. It was a watershed moment which has seen an increase in defamation lawsuits globally as abusers are now emboldened to manipulate the court systems to further abuse their victims. It has had, and will continue to have, huge knock on effects for women and anyone who‚Äôs been a victim of abuse at the hands of powerful men. It made no sense that she didn‚Äôt weigh in‚Ä¶. Unless of course it had something to do with her new Marvel role, and being on Disney payroll. I think for the most part she is well intentioned. And she could have just taken aim at Karl Lagerfeld, but she didn‚Äôt, she is specifically calling out the double standards of people who appear to champion good causes but then manage to put their morals aside for fame, money or a seat at the table. If she hadn‚Äôt taken that angle, I wouldn‚Äôt care so much, but she did and so I believe she is hypocritical. Honestly, there is no squeaky clean version of a Hollywood career. If you work in Hollywood then at some point you‚Äôve turned a blind eye to the inequitable systems in place, the exploitation of others, the rubbing shoulders with literal abusers. If she must have such an ‚Äúall or nothing‚Äù standard for other activists then she should lead by example, ditch the TV career and throw everything she‚Äôs got into her activism. I‚Äôd have mad respect for her if she did that.",

Jameela‚Äôs longterm boyfriend (no idea if they‚Äôre still together) confirmed that she‚Äôd battled cervical cancer twice (and it‚Äôs one of the cancers with the highest recurrence rates) so I guess James Blake is lying too. It‚Äôs crazy how y‚Äôall take those Morrissey ‚Äúreceipts‚Äù as gospel when she‚Äôs financially profiting from ‚Äòexposing‚Äô Jameel, someone who was already widely disliked and thought of as annoying before the Munchausen nonsense started. There‚Äôs a reason Morrisey wasn‚Äôt able to get another job after Vice.\n\nThe rest of it is all just the same white lies every celeb tells to be cool add quirky. EDS causes many other conditions (including food sensitivities/intolerances that some laypeople may call ‚Äúallergies‚Äù, hearing loss, and gut issues). There‚Äôs a reason many disabled groups defended and continue to defend Jameela. And what? Do you think it‚Äôs impossible for her to have been in a car accident or broken bones? She has to be lying about those too?  And before you go saying the EDS is fake too, here is a video of her [demonstrating some of the symptoms](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMYKfBMdu/) and receiving love and support form others with EDS in the comments. As someone who‚Äôs young and conventionally attractive with a disability but doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúlook‚Äù disabled, what I‚Äôm sick of is people invalidating and belittling women‚Äôs lived experiences, especially those of us with chronic illnesses. These diseases are *comorbid*, meaning that someone who has one is more likely to also have others. We are constantly gaslit by doctors, our families, and society at large that we *must* be faking or lying or crazy, especially if we are able to hold jobs and ‚Äòlook‚Äô abled bodied. Congratulations on contributing to the millenia-old trope of calling any woman whose life experiences doesn‚Äôt meet your narrow views a ‚Äúliar‚Äù based on some instagram ‚Äú‚Äù‚Äù‚Äùreceipts‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù from an unemployed ex Vice editor who has never met Jameela in person and built her public platform from people‚Äôs desire to tear down ‚Äòannoying‚Äô women every day.",

Look at this sub for example, every other post is about X or Y being a predator or bigoted or misogynist, yet we were all over the Met threads last night (myself included). Yes, we weren‚Äôt directly celebrating Karl ourselves, but we were watching (and therefore tacitly endorsing the theme). How can we sit here condemning how pervasive misogyny is in Hollywood, condemning the people who said nothing about Weinstein or signed that Polanski letter, yet support a gala thrown in honour of a someone who would‚Äôve defended both and was unapologetically an islamophobic/fatphobic/misogynistic/r*pe apologist? All that tells Hollywood and the fashion industry is that as long as an event has our favourite celebrities in pretty dresses and nice suits we will put aside our morals and watch anyway.\n\nEdit. And the met gala is an optional event for us, none of us *needed* to watch, so I don‚Äôt know why people are comparing it to her job, and saying that she‚Äôs just as bad for working with Disney. Try to find a movie/tv studio that *isn‚Äôt* problematic. That still isn‚Äôt the same as us watching an event none of us are obligated to watch and wouldn‚Äôt affect us if we skipped. People are just mad because they feel called out.",

That burns professional bridges, too, especially when an invite becomes a professional gift of visibility, your name in people's minds, designers with good impressions after dressing you, and opportunities for networking/being linked with bigger names in your field.\n\nIt's why AOC's gown was disingenuous BS when she attended the Met Gala a few (several? idr) years back... you can either opt out, make a quiet creative statement with your presence, or put on the show that is *really* what the people sponsoring your seat & selecting your outfits are paying for. But you don't get to walk past striking laborers in runway couture, kiss the organizers' asses, and then still act like it's this brilliant, subversive thing to accept a $10K seat at the table at a gala for the arts, AND expect me to applaud you for still sitting your ass down & enjoying the catering.\n\nSure, the double standard Jamil is pointing out exists, but there's no actual win here. Karl was in many ways repugnant. Jameela's not wrong. But he's also already dead. And Jameela herself \"went along to get along\" when that Disney cash & having to endure the potential backlash from Depp stans were what was at stake, because the consequences of choosing otherwise would have impacted her personally, professionally, and financially.

Although she‚Äôs known for her diverse roles from films like ‚ÄúThe Help,‚Äù ‚ÄúZero Dark Thirty,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Eyes of Tammy Faye,‚Äù and many more, very little is known about her private life other than what she‚Äôs shared with the world.\nShe met her husband Gian Luca Pasi De Preposulo in 2012 and they married in 2017. It wasn‚Äôt until 2020 when pictures surfaced online of the two of them walking around Santa Monica, CA that we found out they were parents of two children that they had through surrogate. It has also been reported (although just rumor at this point) that they had a third child, also through surrogate.\nSo it is without question that Jessica Chastain still keeps her personal life extremely private & out of the public eye. However, eagle eyed viewers on social media have noticed a trend with her lately as she has been photographed both at events and at random locations in New York City, Los Angeles, and even overseas, not wearing her wedding band. now one could assume that there is nothing behind that but an argument could be made that her and her husband may be separated and or divorced, and because she keeps her personal life so private, no one can really know for sure. But but a picture is worth 1000 words, so I leave it up to you all to figure it out for yourselves. What do you all think?",

Temporary toners are super cheap and very gentle on the hair, great for experimenting with this to find what suits if you do decide to bleach and don't like the platinum!

AND how few BIPOC were in leadership positions, let alone in the room.\n\nI did enjoy Savage Beauty and Heavenly Bodies as well.

Ken is such a good example of a great and caring man. I love that children, especially girls, have cartoons that aren't filled with shitty men. Barbie and Ken also have a good friendship, and it there is no overly \"romantic,\" obsessing about a guy thing that plagues most of the media directed at girls and women.\n\nPete is a shitty guy imo. He has mistreated and used women in the past. But, his \"goofyness\" and bde lets him get away with a lot.\n\nTrigger Warning, he jokes about CSA.\nI have linked an excerpt from the article. It is disgusting and disturbing. There is nothing funny about CSA. This joke was made only a few years ago, at a high point in his career.\n\nhttps://canoe.com/entertainment/celebrity/pete-davidsons-baby-sex-joke-at-standup-gig-shocks-crowd\n\n\"Pete Davidson is telling joke after inappropriate joke ‚Äî but not everyone is laughing.\n\nOn Monday at his comedy event, Pete Davidson And Friends, the funnyman shocked and even angered the crowd with his controversial stories about baby sex and people with disabilities.\n\nOne of his most scandalous routines included a story about how he was babysitting his friend‚Äôs child, and the baby, who is teething, began sucking on his finger ‚Äúbut good,‚Äù he said.\n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to f‚Äî this baby but he‚Äôs asking for it,‚Äù he said, adding that he doesn‚Äôt want to have sex with any babies, but if he did, he would choose that one.\n\nDavidson, 25, whose show took place at The Bell House in Brooklyn, New York, then did an entire routine using the expression ‚Äúmentally retarded‚Äù and saying how funny it was.\n\n‚ÄúPeople wonder why‚Ä¶people are retarded‚Ä¶ Oh I said ‚Äòretarded,‚Äô I don‚Äôt care!‚Äù he said.\n\nThe star also got slammed for repeatedly saying how much he despises people.\n\n‚ÄúI f‚Äîing hate everyone so much,‚Äù he said.\"",

What I have seen says that it‚Äôs a celebration of British performing arts, will have Ian McKellen, Victoria Beckham, London mayor Khan, Stormzy and is being overseen by Stephen Daldry (Billy Elliott director) with some profits going to British Opera House, Royal Ballet etc. so it seems like it is more aimed at British culture I guess? The first vogue world was in NYC last year so the next will probably be Paris or Milan or another big fashion week city.\nI do wish it was a stand alone thing though. Or at least have Edward take the lead than Anna",

The expectation for the outfits having to do with theme comes from people online that have nothing to do with the actual gala other than commenting on it from home. Designers pay a lot of money to have a table because it‚Äôs exposure for the brand. They are there to show off their designs and if the theme does not fit with their design identity and style they‚Äôre probably are not going to incorporate it.
