He had these dogs tied to fences and a puppy left in a mailbox for him to find. Finally I was able to prove to myself at least it was fake. The poor pup tied to the fence was using the same leash (different color) that he used for his dogs. \n\nI know there‚Äôs a fairly popular rescue channel who I‚Äôve seen other rescuers say when they‚Äôre purebred she‚Äôs bought them from a puppy mill to ‚Äúrescue.‚Äù Again you get attacked for pointing out it‚Äôs odd you got given four pug puppies, because the person couldn‚Äôt take care of them. \n\nThere was also a Frenchie that went viral a few years back and it was clear it came from a backyard breeder. He was so small. Within a couple weeks of him going viral they got another frenchie puppy and tagged the breeder. very obviously a backyard breeder. Within a week the other bigger puppy was gone and they acted like it never happened. No one brought it up. Nothing. I saw maybe a year or so ago they posted a video of him as a puppy showing while he was going viral and being shown as the perfect puppy. He had parvo and almost died. I wonder if the other puppy died? Did it give it to this puppy who clearly wasn‚Äôt ready to leave its mom? \n\nI don‚Äôt trust anything online anymore without proof.

Fan Bingbing at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival - (I know she attended this Met Gala, but I feel like most of her Cannes looks would have fitted this theme better)\n\n5. Elsa Hosk at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival - 2019 ‚ÄúCamp: Notes on Fashion\".\n\n6. Last but not least, Biork at the 2001 Oscars - 2019 ‚ÄúCamp: Notes on Fashion\".

In some ways, the act of rehabilitating our aging bodies for the sake of appearing more youthful is an unconscious plea to stave off death. Wanting to appear more youthful for sexual desirability is essentially the same idea with extra steps.",

Pharrell licensed these portraits and this is how they made it onto the lace bodysuit and blazer. Taylor and Future were in the ‚Äúmicro-embroidered‚Äù suits at the gala.¬†\n\nI guess my question to the people here still convinced it was Rosa Parks is: Has Henry Taylor ever produced a portrait of her?

Wonder what Pharrell thought. Maybe he was stretched thin bc his job is menswear. This is a big marketing event. But the female designs + his own pearl jacket don't seem destined for actual product. \n\nSurprising to see LVMH fall on the wrong side of these kinds of controversies.

Still bizarre from a message standpoint-it‚Äôs gauche, but in theme for the figure to be Rosa Parks when the theme for the Met was tailoring black styles. If it‚Äôs just a random neighbor of the stylist what‚Äôs the point of their inclusion?",

That makes me think that either sketches were shared/ leaked, there's a mole on someone's team,  or someone overshared and someone on Anna's team thought it would be interesting/ good for press to utilize Law's old strategy for the client to  be compared to Zendaya for press...\n\n...again, not exactly sure if that's what happened but I just get the feeling this may be a bit more than a coincidence... I could imagine the envy Law gets, being at the absolute top of his industry, especially as a black man, and I often wonder if he gets sabotaged behind the scenes, he even shared a bit before about how hard it still is for him in the industry & what led him to \"retire\" for the time that he did... but , not putting it on Anna because behind the scenes, there are so many team members behind moments like these and you never know who's sharing what.\n\nAs far as the look, Anna doesn't look bad at all  but one to me is clearly tailored better and imo, it's Zendaya. The blazer style that both women wear tends to look better on taller women with a longer torso, and Anna is petite. If she was going to do any type of suiting, I think a shorter blazer that fits better on the arms would've suited her frame better. As far as the pant style, I feel that Anna is swimming in hers a bit, but again, no shade to her, just my two cents on who wore it better. BUT, i do think Anna's hat was crisper/ neater lol.",

The jacket. It looks badly cut or maybe just wrinkled. The shininess clashes with the glittering sequins. A bolero jacket made of the same sequinned material would have been better as it would have kept it more simple. If you absolutely want a jacket like the one worn here, velvet or wool would have been a better material.\n\n2. The round neckline. A higher, v-shaped neckline would have been better.\n\n3. The jewelry. I understand that they have to wear very expensive (rented) jewelry for such occasions, but this necklace really clashes with the outfit. Onyx or jet would have been good materials to wear; I would have chose an Art D√©co style necklace with rectangular onyx panels. Same for the earrings; long onyx drops or onyx studs would have been better. Whoever styled her should also have arranged the necklace so that it is properly centered.\n\n4. The veil adds a second type of sheer fabric. I would have chosen one of the same material as the dress to keep it simple.",

She both challenged and reimagined what it meant to be a performer, carving out a path that reverberates through fashion and popular culture to this day. Her legacy remains an essential chapter in the story of pure cinematic glory and social influence, which has clearly inspired the Met Gala.\n\n\\[Josephine Baker - Wikipedia\\](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephine\\_Baker)",

We can ask these questions all day, gets us no where. At the end of the day it was Biden's, Kamala's and the democrat's strategy. They had all the power. An individual voter has zero. All people wanted was a cease fire, poll after poll showed this, instead they choose to campaign with the likes of Liz Cheney and send more billions while everyday there was new images of kids with bullet holes, infants left to die in incubators, mass starvation, idf being disgusting on social media, calling protesters hamas etc... it was obvious what could happen and their hubris kept them from changing course. Voters didn't do that. They most likely just stayed home. Democrats made that their strategy, it was a mistake and they lost. And they lost to trump. AGAIN. Clearly they should have done something differently.\n\nHow about the dnc rigging the primaries in New Hampshire and Florida? Is that what democracy means, democrats get to pick winners? Despite Biden's dementia and gas lighting that he was better than fine? Running circles around his aids bs... They robbed us of any real choice. There are many mistakes made and still being made constantly. Like them picking that old dude with cancer to run the committee over AOC.\n\nBlaming voters absolves elected officials of their actions, making democracy weaker. It leaves us in this infinite loop of voting for the lesser of 2 evils, made even worse in this two party system. Elected officials have all the power, they're the ones who made the decisions to go with this strategy where as individual voters have zero power.

With British colonial rule in India in the late 1800s early 1900s, dandyism was brought to India by British aristocrats and officials. \n\nIt‚Äôs interesting because Western dandyism has deep ties to black culture and history. But in continents like Europe and Asia, its origins were not specifically black (or at least, that‚Äôs what the history books say). \n\nDiljit‚Äôs look seems to be more of an Eastern take on dandyism, which is really beautiful to see the diversity of the term and lifestyle. \n\nI appreciate that the Met Gala is specifically focused on black style.

Black dandyism came about as way to fight oppression and using fashion as a tool to form their own identity. And yes, there was \"Western African influence filtered through European tailoring\" but the stakes were much higher than just fashion or representing a heritage, it was a fight again social and political oppression. \n\nFor background, I'm Latina so while I'm not South Asian, I have studied South Asian history and spent an academic semester in Punjab a few years ago. My interpretation of Diljit's outfit is that he took inspiration from Maharaja Bhupinder, Maharaja Yadavinder, and Maharaja Duleep Singh. Duleep Singh who was the last Maharaja of the Sikh empire and also known as the Black Prince of Perthshire whereas Maharaja Bhupinder was well known as an eastern Dandy or the Dandy of Punjab. \n\nI see Diljit as combining the word play on the \"Black\" Prince's name and the Dandy of Punjab to create a Black Dandy look that is \"Tailored\" to fit his identity, his self expression, and as a form of resistance. That play on words is pretty clever and shows a unique twist while still paying homage to Black Dandyism as well as a personal tailored version of identity and resistance.\n\nAlso I don't think he was trying to represent South Asians as a whole bc the Gurmukhi lettering (a Punjabi script created by the second Sikh guru) on his outfit and the map of Eastern Punjab is referring to the political, social, and lingual oppression Punjab has been facing in India since the partition but especially so in the last 4 decades.",

They were just having fun and experimenting.\n\nI always (then and now) just ask for a little clean up and to just follow my natural brow line.  That's how I survived the 90s with my brows intact.\n\nI'll never really understand brows having trends because they're what frame the face, so it can't be subject to trends, IMO.  It's got to be about what's best for your face.\n\nSorta like, I'd never embrace purple eyeshadow  (although that's obviously not a permanent thing) because it doesn't work with my skin tone.  I don't care if it becomes a trend. That doesn't change what looks best on me.\n\nETA:  Not that I haven't ever embraced certain trends!  ü§£ I certainly have, but I'm always wary of a \"trend\" that could be permanent, because the two are incongruous.",

Miller. ‚ÄúHistorical manifestations of dandyism range from absolute precision in dress and tailoring to flamboyance and fabulousness in dress and style. Whether a dandy is subtle or spectacular, we recognize and respect the deliberateness of the dress, the self-conscious display, the reach for tailored perfection, and the sometimes subversive self-expression.‚Äù¬†\n\nThe exhibit, ‚ÄúSuperfine: Tailoring Black Style,‚Äù draws on other sources beyond Miller‚Äôs book. It‚Äôs organized into 12 sections. Each symbolizes a characteristic of dandy style as defined by Zora Neale Hurston in her 1934 essay, ‚ÄúCharacteristics of Negro Expression.‚Äù Among them: ownership, presence, distinction, disguise, freedom, respectability and heritage. Presumably, for gala guests who do deep-dive research (or have stylists to do it), some of these factors will play out on the museum steps that serve as the event‚Äôs red carpet.¬†\n\n**DRESS CODE:** Tailored for You: tailoring and suiting as interpreted through the history and meaning of Black dandyism across the Atlantic diaspora.",

Miller‚Äôs 2009 book Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity. The book explores how Black men transformed a style once imposed upon them into a tool for self-expression, resistance, and dignity.\n\n‚Äî The Met Gala raises money through ticket sales. Major fashion houses often purchase entire tables and then invite guests to attend wearing their designs. This is money that would otherwise be spent on private marketing‚Äîbut here, it goes toward a public cultural institution.\n\n‚Äî Not all clothing is meant to be practical or \"presentable\" by conventional standards. Some garments are made as artistic statements. Even if you wouldn‚Äôt wear something to the office, you can still appreciate the creativity and technical mastery behind it.\n\n‚Äî Events like this provide work for countless tailors, embroiderers, textile specialists, and artisans‚Äîmany of whom produce garments entirely by hand. Such artisans also help you appreciate other forms of art, such as theatre and movies, which require costuming.*",

    "selftext": "Listening to Amy Poehler‚Äôs episode on Smartless reignited my old interest in her and Will Arnett‚Äôs relationship, so I decided to do a little deep dive on their history and the gossip surrounding their marriage.¬†\n\nIt ended up being super long, so I‚Äôm just gonna give a little table of contents in case you want to skip to what most interests you:\n\n‚Ä¢ Poehler/Arnett timeline\n‚Ä¢ Rumors and Gossip\n‚Ä¢ Arnett cheating rumors (Christina Applegate, general sleaze)¬†\n ‚Ä¢ Poehler cheating rumors (Seth Meyers, Nick Kroll, Adam Scott, Paul Rudd)\n‚Ä¢ Odds and Ends\n‚Ä¢ Conclusion\n\n\n\n**Timeline**\n\nA quick timeline based on official and confirmed details/interviews ie no rumors.\n\n1996: Will Arnett, dating actress Missy Yeager, goes to see a UCB show and loves it so much that his girlfriend accuses him of having a crush on Amy, which he admits to in an interview I lost track of </3 She's dating comedian Matt Besser at the time.¬†\n\n2000: Will Arnett gets sober after a low point in his alcoholism in mid 2000. Towards the end of the year, they‚Äôre both at a big group dinner where Poehler is on a second date with one of his friends. That doesn‚Äôt work out, so she spends the whole night talking to Arnett.¬†In a 2005 interview with TV Without Pity, he said of their meeting, ‚ÄúWe had sort of met before, but we started dating. From the moment we met, it was the greatest thing that ever happened to me. It was great. We didn't know what we were doing, and all of a sudden she got SNL, so we kind of decided that I guess I had to move to New York; otherwise it wasn't going to work out. So I moved back to New York and it was the greatest. It was great. Probably the best thing that's ever happened to me is Amy.‚Äù\n\n2001: Poehler and Arnett have begun a more serious relationship. She joins the cast of *Saturday Night Live* in the fall, and they move in together in New York. Said Arnett in a 2016 interview, ‚ÄúIt was a great time, I was in love with the person I wanted to be with, and I was back to making good money. It was like, 'Oh wait, if I get sober, this is all it takes?'\"\n\n2003-2006: They pair gets married in 2003, right as Arnett is starting *Arrested Development*, which shoots in Los Angeles. He flew back to New York between shooting to marry her then had to go back to Los Angeles. He would return to New York between seasons, and she would fly out to LA ‚Äúevery two to three weeks‚Äù between SNL show weeks.¬†Said Poehler of this time, \"We're just happy to spend time together. We spread out and read each other the paper\"\n\n2008: They have their first child, Archie, in the fall. Cute. Poehler leaves SNL and begins working on NBC‚Äôs *Parks and Recreation*, so the couple moves to Los Angeles while they film.¬†\n\n2010: They have their second child, Abel. Cute.¬†Parks and Recreation starts becoming more popular.\n\n2012: In September, a few weeks after a blind item from Lainey Gossip, Poehler and Arnett announce their separation, saying they just feel ‚Äúmore like best friends.‚Äù I believe the 2012 comedy awards in April and the Met Gala in May were their last appearances as a couple.¬†I would place their split sometime in June/July because of a story Poehler and John Stamos have told about a ~date/not-date. The only time I know of that they‚Äôve worked together was when he made a cameo in *They Came Together* (2014), which was filmed in July of 2012, so it makes sense to me that Poehler and Arnett were newly separated around this time.¬†\n\n2013: Poehler starts dating Nick Kroll in ~March, and they stay together until 2015.¬†\n\n2014: Arnett files for divorce from Poehler.¬†\n\n2016: Arnett and Poehler‚Äôs divorce is finalized. Megan Fox goes on Conan O‚ÄôBrien to make fun of Arnett for dating a slew of progressively younger women while filming *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles*.¬†\n\n2020: Arnett has a baby with socialite Alessandra Brawn. Around the same time, Arnett and Poehler quarantine together with their two sons. Based on what he‚Äôs said in interviews, this year also sounds like roughly the (positive) turning point for their amicability post-separation. ¬†\n\nPresent day: The pair gets along amicably, though Arnett admits it‚Äôs taken them a while to get to this point. Arnett dated socialite Alessandra Brawn from 2019-2024. No breakup has been confirmed, but it‚Äôs been heavily speculated, as he‚Äôs been seen out with other women and has stopped mentioning her on Smartless. Poehler is dating a former New York Times editor who seems very normal like a friend‚Äôs nice dad.¬†\n\n\n**RUMORS AND GOSSIP:**\n\nThough the pair have never confirmed any major marital conflict, there have been several rumors about their split, mostly pertaining to infidelity and alcoholism. Arnett relapsed sometime while working on *Flaked*, a highly autobiographical TV show that he conceptualized in late summer of 2012 (ie. around when they separated) and completed in 2016. He‚Äôs never said anything about his alcoholism re: their marriage. The exact dates of this relapse are unknown, but he is happy and sober now. Yay\n\n**WILL ARNETT CHEATING RUMORS:**\n\nArnett has been heavily speculated to be a cheater and a ‚Äúdog‚Äù in general (one commenter alleged they witnessed Rachel Dratch‚ÄîPoehler‚Äôs good friend‚Äîcall him such). There has been a lot of gossip about him cheating with a slew of women throughout their marriage, and, I have to say, his dating history post-divorce makes him look at least a little sleazy. Additionally, a lot of people see his roles over the years as evidence that he is a depressed, womanizing, alcoholic. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to assume an actor is the exact same as their characters, but he does have a typecast.¬†\n\nChristina Applegate: One widespread rumor about Arnett was that he had an affair with Christina Applegate while shooting their short-lived sitcom Up All Night. The showrunner was Emily Spivey, and Maya Rudolph also starred, so this show was just swarming with friends of Poehler, and it ended abruptly in 2012 after 2 seasons. Applegate, who was with a long-term partner at the time, vaguely denied these rumors on social media. I‚Äôve also heard it rumored that Arnett was not cheating with Applegate but rather a producer on the show (whom he later dated). Either way, Rudolph was an early guest on Smartless and was very friendly with Arnett, which I sort of doubt she would do if he was blatantly cheating on one of her best friends right in front of her.¬†But what do I know?\n\n**AMY POEHLER CHEATING RUMORS:**\n\nWhile not speculated to be a frequent cheater like her alleged slut ex husband, there have been a fair share of rumors guessing which man, if any, ruined their marriage from her side because she has a lot of guy friends and is maybe a bit of a flirt. I‚Äôll address these rumors from least believable to most IN MY OPINION.¬†\n\n**Seth Meyers:**¬†\n\nThis is not as reliable a rumor as the Tiktok edits would suggest.\n\nMeyers started working with Poehler in 2001 after similarly developing a crush on her after watching her do improv. He was a big fan and super excited to work with her, recalling that his initial reaction to getting the job ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt ‚Äôoh my God I‚Äôm gonna be on SNL;‚Äô it was ‚Äòoh my God, I‚Äôm gonna get to work with Amy Poehler.‚Äô‚Äù The two became close friends very quickly, and it is widely rumored that he had a big big crush on her. At one of their live shows, Tina Fey and Poehler joked that if Poehler and Meyers ever kissed in a sketch, it was because Meyers wrote it. They were also often seen hugging/forehead kissing/light mouth smooching at the SNL goodnights that air at the end of the show.¬†\n\nIn an interview with Howard stern, Meyers admitted to having romantic feelings towards Poehler before they worked together.¬† Meyers didn‚Äôt date anyone from the time he started at SNL with Poehler until 2008, when he started dating Alexi Ashe. They would get engaged in 2013, one year after Poehler‚Äôs separation. This dynamic has always seemed, to me, to be a one-sided crush that Poehler entertained but didn‚Äôt quite reciprocate. I think if he was the cause of her divorce, they probably would have dated at least a little instead of him immediately getting married to his current wife.¬†\n\n**Louis CK:** From what I can tell, these rumors mostly stem from the fact that Poehler and Arnett‚Äôs second child is a redhead. 1) genes aren‚Äôt that simple. 2) Arnett was also a redhead as a baby. ¬†\n\n**Nick Kroll:**¬†\n\nThese rumors are based on the fact that Poehler dated Kroll from 2013-2015. Poehler and Kroll were first seen together in March 2013, 6 months after her separation from Arnett was announced (not necessarily when it happened). People have wondered if there may have been some overlap, especially because Poehler and Kroll have known each other pretty well since the 2000s and worked together on Parks and Recreation around the time of the split.¬†They've remained friends since their breakup and said they split because of their busy schedules.\n\nOn his TV show Big Mouth, Kroll voices The Hormone Monster, a horny puberty imaginary friend of the main characters; viewers have pointed out that the hormone monster sounds exactly like Arnett and have speculated it might be a jab at him. Additionally, Poehler sparked feud rumors when she was asked in a Howard Stern interview if Arnett and Kroll got along, and she answered only, ‚ÄúThey know each other.‚Äù\n\n**Adam Scott:**\n\nAdam Scott was a huge SNL/Amy Poehler fan who began working with her on Parks and Recreation in 2010 after the failure of his TV show Party Down. He always spoke very highly of her. It must be noted that Scott has been married since 2005 (after dating his now-wife since 1998 with 1 year-long breakup somewhere in there) with no substantial cheating rumors and no hint of having any sort of open relationship. This would make him a big cheater if true. Also, Poehler has publicly called Scott and Seth Meyers hot by far the most of any of these suspects.\n\nIn early spring 2012, when they were finishing shooting the 4th season of Parks, Scott asked Poehler to be in the movie A.C.O.D with him playing his step mom. She agreed, and the movie shot in Atlanta in March/April. Shortly after, they were seen around in New York City sans spouses, sometimes with Seth Meyers. They went to dinners and saw movies and UCB shows together. While this isn‚Äôt incriminating on its own, I find the dates very interesting. They went to Atlanta in March/April and New York in April, right before the Comedy Awards (ie. the last time Arnett/Poehler were seen together as a couple. Also Scott and Poehler seemed kind of flirty that night). As far as I can tell, there was no professional reason for Scott to be in New York, and he was there alone.\n\nThey continued to be very close throughout the production of Parks and Recreation, but seemingly drifted apart after. In the 2015 special on Late Night with Seth Meyers that aired right after the Parks finale, Poehler and Scott sat very far away from each other and didn‚Äôt address each other once despite doing frequent bits together in (literally) every other panel throughout the show‚Äôs run. In 2021 or 2022, Deuxmoi posted a blind item with a Parks and Recreation reference as a subject line about two costars of an old sitcom that used to spend a lot more time together than was known and no longer liked each other.¬†\n\nThey‚Äôve since made appearances together at the 2023 SAG awards (where they presented an award together and walked the red carpet with Aubrey Plaza) and at the premiere of Agatha All Along (which they both attended to support Aubrey Plaza and Kathryn Hahn. Fun fact: this was Poehler‚Äôs birthday). A commenter on this subreddit also said they saw Scott in the audience at Poehler and Fey‚Äôs live show and saw him leave from the stage door.¬†\n\nLast tidbit: Some may recall recent gossip site headlines that popped up after Arnett asked Scott on Smartless if he‚Äôs ever ‚Äúhad an emotional affair with a coworker.‚Äù\n\n**Paul Rudd:**\n\nI‚Äôm not really sure where the Paul Rudd rumors came from, but they're the most widespread in gossip circles, and I kind of believe them (partially because I think that would be hot). They worked together on the 2001 film Wet Hot American Summer, where it has been rumored they had a fling on set; you can see them interact in the BTS documentary *Hurricane of Fun*. This was before they got with their respective spouses, and for the movie, all of the actors had to spend a month at a summer camp together.¬†Since getting hitched, it has been rumored that the Rudds have some sort of deal re: extramarital activities. \n\nIn 2012, the rumor resurfaced, partially because of a CDAN blind (I know, I‚Äôm sorry) and partially because of a few alleged sightings. Generally, I‚Äôve seen a fair amount of people repeating this rumor, especially in the comments of an older Deuxmoi blind item (which I don't think I can link) alleging Poehler had an affair with a very famous man, which Deuxmoi essentially confirmed on Instagram was allegedly about Rudd. Additionally, *They Came Together* was shot in July 2012, right before Poehler/Arnett announced their split. Fun fact: before shooting a movie with Rudd, Tina Fey called Poehler to ask about Rudd and if they would get along. It‚Äôs interesting to me that, of all the people Fey knows, she thought Poehler would have the best answers re Rudd‚Äôs personality. The pair was also seen hanging out a bit, including sightings with Adam Scott (Rudd‚Äôs best friend).¬†\n\n**Odds and ends:**\n\nIn a 2016 interview with The Hollywood Reporter from which I‚Äôve pulled a few things, Arnett said of his character in *Flaked*: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs had his heart broken, and I think that that‚Äôs the part that I share with Chip. And then at the end of episode six, he‚Äôs proved right: that when he finally let somebody in, he gets betrayed ‚Äî and it‚Äôs like, ‚ÄòYep, that‚Äôs why you can‚Äôt let anybody in.‚Äô And, yeah, I felt the same way.‚Äù\n\nIn Poehler‚Äôs book, she mostly brushes aside her divorce from Arnett, but, she lists ‚Äúall men cheat‚Äù as something that everyone says to someone who‚Äôs getting divorced.¬†\n\nPoehler, Rudd, and Scott have all recently been guests on Smartless‚Äîall invited on by Sean Hayes.¬†\n\nIn his interview with Dax Shepard on Armchair Expert, Arnett said he sometimes asked *Bojack Horseman* creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg if he was mining his life for content. I feel like this is an interesting glimpse into Arnett‚Äôs character as Bojack is a famously depressed, self-destructive, toxic, selfish horse.¬†\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nI‚Äôve been collecting tea about this couple intermittently before me for years now, and this is just about everything. They seem to be in a great place now, and her episode on Smartless is a fantastic listen‚Äîwould recommend‚Äîvery entertaining and sweet.¬†\n\nSome of the sightings/articles I referenced can‚Äôt be linked on here because this sub can be finicky with links they‚Äôre from Twitter or they‚Äôre screenshots of old Tumblr posts, but I didn‚Äôt make any of this up I swear. If any of it is made up, it‚Äôs because the source made it up (which is VERY possible as a lot of my sources are gossip sites and random commenters). I also tried to link my sources, but something about that isn't complying with this sub's rules. I just sought to gather as much as I could and lay it all out for anyone who comes after me and is curious. Take all of this with a grain of salt and please feel free to share any questions/concerns/additional gossip in the comments!",
