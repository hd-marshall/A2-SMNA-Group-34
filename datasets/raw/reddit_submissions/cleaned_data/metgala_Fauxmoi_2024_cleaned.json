For a couple years around 2020 it seemed like Kim was shifting into a new direction—law and social justice—and I thought that was the perfect move, both for her “brand” and the world. But in the last 2 years especially they’ve seemed to double down on the vanity and the excessive displays of wealth and wastefulness, which most of the world is just pretty repulsed by at this point. I’m 38, so seeing Kim and Khloe desperately trying to hang on to their youth is just depressing. I would have loved to have seen them become more confident in themselves as they aged but instead they seem to be regressing and it’s just uncomfortable to watch them change their faces and bodies every month.",

This includes doing photo shoots and her likeness being used in ads and promos. Idk how accurate that is to her actual contract. I’m not a lawyer well versed in these types of contracts (the op who posted on the Kardashians sub was though I believe). \n\nI couldn’t imagine that, especially as the brand has lost its status.

I wouldn’t have her at the top of my list currently for fashion, but historically she’s made a HUGE impact. Her style is always evolving, she’s not afraid to push boundaries with big hats or metallic fabrics, and she always looks chic and sharp. \n\nZendaya is definitely in my top 3 fashion stars right now, probably slot 1 or 2. A queen. She has been a huge influence in the recent trend of movie stars making their red carpet fashion match the vibes of the movie they’re promoting. Timothee C has credited her with this as well. \n\nBad bunny also wears a lot of exciting looks. He frequently wears more feminine styles such as his 2022 met gala look which featured a suit skirt and updo, or his music video featuring him in a red latex mini skirt. I love to see shifting gender norms in fashion. It’s so rare to see him in a plain black suit it actually becomes interesting when he does. \n\nChris hemsworth is.. well uh… he tries to… his style is very… um…",

I also hate the culture surrounding the genre.\n\nBut, Bad Bunny is an exemption to me, his music is very unique, he often has smart lyrics and I really like his voice because it's so different. I also love that he was the first man from that culture that wasn't afraid to explore her feminine side.\n\nLike in this video [Yo Perreo Sola](https://youtu.be/GtSRKwDCaZM?si=4E89Yo2TLD-2PgvG)\n\nI also like the lyrics of that song, it's very funny but it's weirdly empowering too.\n\nHe was really a pioneer, now I have seen a lot of men in the genre leaving behind the very \"macho\" aspect of it and I've listened more and more songs without the toxic masculinity often associated with reggaeton, so good for him.\n\nI, unfortunately, listen to a lot of reggaeton against my will because you can't go anywhere without hearing it, it's like an epidemic.",

I haven’t read much about it but I think it’s been linked to the met by Anna wintour and Vogue to try to bring some publicity to it as it’s only in its second year. What I have seen says that it’s a celebration of British performing arts, will have Ian McKellen, Victoria Beckham, London mayor Khan, Stormzy and is being overseen by Stephen Daldry (Billy Elliott director) with some profits going to British Opera House, Royal Ballet etc. so it seems like it is more aimed at British culture I guess? The first vogue world was in NYC last year so the next will probably be Paris or Milan or another big fashion week city.\nI do wish it was a stand alone thing though. Or at least have Edward take the lead than Anna",

It’s the universal Condé experience on an even larger, more intense scale, proving that there would be no @condenast—or Met Gala—without us.\n\n>Overwork, but no Overtime—Making the Met Gala takes hours of extra work from the entire @voguemagazine team, not to mention other employees throughout the company.
