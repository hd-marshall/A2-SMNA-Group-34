Given that Tom has history at Saint Laurent in the late 90s, it‚Äôs a fun call back to his legacy in fashion. Which is in line with the theme of the exhibit ‚ÄúReawakening Fashion‚Äù, in the sense of reinvigorating historical fashion. The jacket is [Le Smoking](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Smoking), a line from SL in 1996. (Though some may argue 90s fashion isn‚Äôt historical, it sadly is considered vintage at this point). \n\nSo he is playing into the exhibit theme of historical fashion, and as far as dress code I would say it‚Äôs as simple as the flower boutonni√®re being on theme with the garden aspect, along with the color of the jacket being a deep red rose color. But I agree he‚Äôs definitely playing more into the theme than the dress code.",

The magazines, how they treated Hillary Duff, how they treated Britney Spears when she performed Gimme More at the VMAs. I'm so sorry to hear about your suffering, especially since back then most people's response to eating disorders was \"JuSt EaT a SaNdWhIcH!!1!\" But you had to be so strong to overcome that, and I wish those same people understood what that takes. The fact diet culture's messaging was so strong they actually screened all media during treatment is mind blowing... I always thought I was fat from that messaging too, at 5'5\"-6\" and 135 lbs... (and the fact that my high school boyfriend bought into it wholesale and regurgitated it back to me didn't help), but my ED didn't surface until right after high school. My mom got me a trainer at LA Fitness thinking it'd help me feel better, but instead it turned into me purging by over-exercising and restricting my calories to only \"1200\" a day (though I always over-estimated so it was likely even less), I refused to ever sit, I'd park in the back of a parking lot and RUN to the store when I went shopping, I ate the same strictly regimented things at the same time every day until you could literally see every bone in my body, even my sternum without breathing in, and my period completely went away. It was at this point I started running into this creepy guy in a local bookstore (I'd go and read baking recipes which I'd then make for others and eat none of myself), and one of the times he approached me he complimented my body and asked how I stay in \"such great shape.\" Even then I was appalled. But I didn't get better until the nutritionist I was VERY lucky to have, told me that if I didn't stop what I was doing, my heart was either going to stop, or explode. And recovery was still a long, painful road.\n\nIt's a great insight that skincare is the new gen's version of weight loss for us, and while I don't have kids either, I find it kind of bittersweet... I'm glad that the new fixation is less of an immediate health risk, but also sad that it's just a different iteration of the same thing all over again - an obsession with the only two things we're told by mass media make us \"worthy\", youth and beauty. This is even highlighted by the \"clean girl\" trend, it's right out in the open that you're expected to look \"naturally beautiful\" and showing that it's still a trick but even then it's still the unobtainable dream that girls actively pursue... I suspect it's the same struggle our parents had, because no matter how many times you're told that media is an illusion, the messaging burrows deeper than that. It sucks, to say the least. But we came out of it, with scars but we did it... so these girls will be okay too, and they're at least more media savvy than we were, so hopefully the cuts aren't as deep and the trend keeps going until we're just clear of shit like this altogether.\n\nIf you happen to still be here after that novel, though... I'm glad you made it through and that you made it out on top. 11-20 is a long time, and I know that battle wasn't easy. I can't imagine what it really took. But I know it means you're awesome, and I'm happy you're here.",

The time suck and cost of going through a lawsuit (even if it plays out in arbitration) isn‚Äôt negligible, and it‚Äôs why a lot of people ultimately follow the NDAs they‚Äôve signed. \n\nAlso like I said, not *all* NDAs are unenforceable- in fact they regularly hold up. If this one actually says what he claims it does, it‚Äôs bizarre (how does reposting count as a ‚Äúdisclosure‚Äù..?) and yes likely not enforceable because it‚Äôs overbroad and not actually protecting sensitive information. Big emphasis on IF it says what he claims it does tho lol, this guy doesn‚Äôt sound like he‚Äôs got a firm grasp on the terms of the NDA. \n\nOther types of NDAs are *absolutely* enforceable though. If you sign an NDA when you become employed at a company before that company allows you access to sensitive data and information (like product development, business strategies, trade secrets, marketing strategies‚Äî tons of things), the duty not to publicly disclose that information will *totally* hold up in court. Even NDAs about the production behind reality shows regularly hold up in arbitrations. \n\nI think that people may be conflating NDAs with non-competes. Non-competes are actually tougher to enforce than NDAs, because they directly limit a person from future employment/earning a livelihood. But NDAs are not as frowned upon and not as difficult to draft in a way that‚Äôs enforceable.",

What situations or circumstances might make an NDA unenforceable?\n>Again, this might vary from state to state, but there are several instances in which a court may determine that a non-disclosure agreement is unenforceable. A few examples of how this might happen include, but are not limited to:\n\n>The agreement language is too broad: If the NDA is overly broad or restrictive, it's more likely that a court will find problems with it, especially if it's not limited in scope or duration.\n>The information is not confidential: It's certainly going to be harder for the company to convince a court to uphold the NDA against an employee if the information has already been widely disclosed or is public knowledge.\n>The agreement is requesting the employee do something illegal: For example, the employer requests that the employee remain quiet about something that the employee has a legal duty to report.\n>But these are just a handful of the almost endless list of circumstances in which a non-disclosure agreement may be unenforceable.",

NDAs protecting sensitive information and trade secrets are regularly enforced by courts.

Non-competes have basically never had teeth, even before the FTC‚Äôs new rule.

Non-competes actually purport to interfere with and limit how a person can earn a future livelihood. Public policy generally frowns upon limitations on a person‚Äôs freedom to work and earn money. Telling someone they can‚Äôt ever work at a competitor in their field after they‚Äôve worked for you would be a *huge* hindrance to someone‚Äôs ability to earn a living. Even restricting someone from taking such a job for a few months is a ridiculous infringement on them. So that‚Äôs why non-competes are disfavored. \n\nThat really doesn‚Äôt apply to NDAs. There IS a strong public policy reason to prevent employees from disclosing a company‚Äôs trade secrets and sensitive information after their employment ends. And companies wouldn‚Äôt enter into transactions with each other that require the sharing of sensitive information if the other company could just turn around and publicize it. It would be really difficult for businesses to function competitively if former employees could disclose sensitive information once they leave. And there‚Äôs no real persuasive countervailing reason to *allow* a former employee to do that‚Äî it‚Äôs not predatory or limiting for a former employee to keep the sensitive info of a former employer secret. So NDAs have a really valid purpose behind them. \n\nWhat we see a lot on this sub are NDAs that celebrities seem to make everyone in their lives sign. That enters a more grey area for a lot of reasons‚Äî maybe there‚Äôs an absence of a business relationship that was mutually beneficial (eg they made some rando entering their house sign one but didn‚Äôt ever employ that person or confer to them any benefit), was the information that can‚Äôt be shared actually sensitive info, is the NDA totally overbroad.

You cry for equality, scream bloody murder when a woman gets beaten by a man, but then cheer on happily when a woman attacks a man. What do you want, equality, or superiority? \n\nNo one is right in that situation. Well, the bodyguard for holding her back, he's good people.",

There's also the video of her at that basketball ball game staring straight ahead and swaying back and forth for an uncomfortably long time. I heard another story about her at, I believe, one of Diddy's white parties, where she apparently got into the pool (maybe even fully clothed) and just stood there for hours, causing Solange to freak out and eventually get removed from the party. \n\nBut of course, that's all rumours. But there are people who swear that's the case. Whatever it was, I'm hesitant to go with the narrative that Jay Z and Beyonce themselves put out. Their PR is top notch and they're notoriously quiet about their personal life. I don't see why they'd feel the need to tell us the truth. They could've easily said nothing at all, but I think Jay Z saw the controversy as a way to sell more records, so he gave it his own spin.

    "title": "Met Gala Misconceptions",
    "selftext": "I posted the following as a comment a few months ago and people found it helpful. I thought reposting today might be useful before the Met Gala red carpet coverage tonight:\n\nThere are a lot of misconceptions about the Met Gala that drive me nuts.\n\nFirstly, it‚Äôs a charity event to raise money for the Met‚Äôs Costume Institute, not a random fancy-dress ball.\n\nSecondly, the ‚Äútheme‚Äù is the subject of that year‚Äôs special exhibition. Calls to ‚Äújust change the theme‚Äù a few weeks before the event because it‚Äôs controversial, like ‚ÄúKarl Lagerfield: A Line of Beauty,‚Äù are silly because museum exhibits are planned well in advance. There would be no feasible way to just have a different exhibition at the last minute.\n\nThirdly, speaking of themes, there is no requirement for attendees to dress to match the subject of the exhibition (EDIT: dress code this year is ‚Äúgarden of time.‚Äù Sometimes it‚Äôs more general like ‚Äúwhite tie.‚Äù). Many do, because it‚Äôs fun and good press, but the constant ‚Äúit‚Äôs great but they don‚Äôt match the theme ‚òπÔ∏è‚Äù discourse after every Met Gala is eyeroll-worthy.\n\nLastly, most celebrities who attend the Met Gala are guests of the invited designers/fashion houses (some do buy their own ticket but they‚Äôre a minority). Therefore, if Margot Robbie is a guest of Chanel, then she has to wear Chanel. This also impacts the ‚Äúfollowing the theme‚Äù aspect - e.g. the celebrity guests for Moschino looked great at the ‚ÄúCamp: Notes on Fashion‚Äù gala but, unsurprisingly, looked less great at the ‚ÄúChina: Through the Looking Glass‚Äù gala. And no one really, except Rihanna, went for the Rei Kawakubo/Commes des Gar√ßons theme.\n\nSo, I love fashion, and love how much discussion the Met Gala generates. It‚Äôs like the red carpet Olympics, but the overexposure plus lack of understanding of why people might be wearing what they‚Äôre wearing can be irritating.",

She‚Äôs wearing an American brand by an American designer. She‚Äôs mixing bridal with street fashion (both clearly American in style). She‚Äôs paying homage to headwear worn on the runway with this gown (it was a horse jockey helmet), but switched it up to be a baseball hat (does it get more American than baseball?)

There is a lot of shade thrown at historical costuming as an area of study that stems from pure misogyny.

This year‚Äôs theme really highlights the importance of conservation, and the work that goes into textile preservation. We learn a lot from what people wore through the years, and those garments degrade over time when exposed to air, light, and body oils. Their work is preserving some of the most delicate historical objects in existence, and yet they get no funding for their efforts largely because it has historically been the realm of women and queer men.

The Met Gala continued annually but at different venues, similar to other philanthropy events at the time. The Met Gala didn't focused as much on celebrity culture in the early years, it was simply an upscale fundraiser for high society. \n\nThe first themed year was 1973 and it was \"The World of Balenciaga\". The structure of a theme has been continued since then. The theme is what started to set it apart from other fundraisers and galas, they also had started to invite more celebrities and models to attend which elevated it's status while gaining additional exposure. The theme is a big part of why the Met Gala is as popular as it is today.",

A tax writeoff is an expense you can claim as a deduction. The attendees expend the cost of the ticket and then claim it as a deduction.\n\nIt's the same with charity auctions. If you bid $4000 for a spa day at an auction, and it would normally cost $500, it's $3,500 of your income that you don't have to pay taxes on. If you join your local public radio station for $60 and they send you a $10 tote bag, you can claim a $50 donation.",

At galas I have attended (annually raised 5+ million each event) the $$$ we would donate for fund a need. We would routinely overbid the value on items (as you noted above) and deduct the difference. Clients of ours are wine makers, they would donate wine and deduct associated expenses related. Do I need to continue, or are we good? :)\n\nPerhaps the Met Gala does not include an auction or donated items for the attendees that those vendors could deduct? I'm more interested in the fashion at this point, than discussing work I no longer do. Cheers!",

This was the theme for the gala‚Äôs exhibit which put out various archival pieces like this on display. Vogue had a great description of it - ‚Äúembodying the beauty of the natural world, its fragility, and its inevitable decay.‚Äù\n\nTyla‚Äôs dress fits the theme because she‚Äôs the only one to have worn it, and as Olivier cuts it, the gown disappears and can‚Äôt be re-worn. It‚Äôs a dress that was designed with the knowledge that it would inevitably be destroyed. The exhibit is also broken into subthemes of Land, Sea and Sky and I think the use of sand does a good job of invoking this nature/elemental aspect.\n\nThe dress code was The Garden of Time, which is based on a short story of the same name and goes hand in hand with the idea of inevitable decay. In the story the characters are rich and living in a luxurious villa, and they must pluck flowers from their garden to reverse time and stave off an angry mob that comes nearer every hour. Eventually they run out of flowers and the villa is overtaken, becoming destroyed by the mob.\n\nTyla‚Äôs outfit is meant to invoke this theme of time passing. It‚Äôs inspired by the phrase ‚Äúthe sands of time,‚Äù which is a saying used to describe the passage of time. She carried an hourglass with her on the carpet to tie in this concept of sand with time trickling by.\n\nIt‚Äôs a thought provoking but difficult theme to dress for! I love that her take is both unique and shows a real understanding of the event‚Äôs concept.",

At this point we have good treatments and we have an effective vaccine. \n\nIt's more normalized, but people still die of influenza as well. And RSV, and pneumonia.. the list goes on and on.\n\nCOVID has been evolving to be more contagious and less severe (same reason why today's flu is so much less severe than the Spanish Flu). We are vaccinated for COVID for a reason and it's a non issue for 99%+ of the population. \n\nPeople have the right to take the safety precautions that are the best for them and their health, but frankly it's not reasonable to expect the vast majority of people to continue to social distance or wear masks for COVID anymore. If you are advocating for wearing masks and social distancing every time you get sick (with COVID, influenza, sinus infections) that is your right, but you're in the vast minority and you can't be upset when other people don't want to live their lives that way",

And she always had some level of privacy/distance with her fans. No mess that I can recall. She also used to be in a clique of very famous influencers that a lot of teens watched (the Dolan twins and I think James Charles pre scandal).\n\nA lot of people have talked about, and I think she herself is kind of grappling, with the situation now that she's not relatable anymore. I've heard some saying she lacks perspective and should have gone to college or done more 'regular people' things to gain some experience, but at the same time a lot of people find her comforting or entertaining. I think she's also reflecting on the situation a lot and doesn't come across as trying too hard to either remain relatable or flaunt her wealth, she comes across as pretty authentic (which I realize isn't necessarily actual authenticity).\n\nTo me she came across as very smart, creative and driven. A lot of people copied her editing style at the time. I also felt that she had a solid support system with her parents, but I don't know enough about her to be sure on that-it just feels like she's been able to stay pretty down to earth. I didn't perceive her as trying to milk as much as possible from her fame, rather like she was strategic and picky about what she did, and took some risks.\n\nI don't keep up with her a lot but she's one of the only influencers whose transition into the established 'offline' entertainment industry has felt pretty natural, to me. I think that's both down to her personality/talent for what she does now, and her management/how she's perceived by brands or how she's managed. As someone else said, her being thin and white but not having the classic influencer look plus her established interest in fashion puts her in a good position to work with more high fashion brands. She doesn't have Instagram Face, doesn't flaunt logos or post amazon fashion hauls to my recollection, and already positioned herself as a fashion girlie, and imo she comes across as someone who doesn't cling to influencer numbers as much as others and is ready to sacrifice some of her following for her career. That might make her more attractive to luxury brands. In that way she's similar to bestdressed aka Ashley.",

I never understood her YouTube success, but she had a developed a huge following there when vlogs and collabs were a huge thing. She started a coffee brand and getting asked to go to Paris Fashion Week, and I see that as the beginning of her transition to whatever this is now. I‚Äôm curious as to how many stans have stuck around. She‚Äôs not covertly unrelatable like she used to be. Seems like this would be openly and majorly unrelatable to most people. \n\nId love for a longtime fan to weigh in (was it her burps and skin issues and anxiety, etc that you felt you could connect with?)

She didn‚Äôt look like a celebrity but the way she was casually chatting everyone up, I honestly assumed she was an intern journalist or something who was trying *a little* too hard to get a foot in the door with the elites. \n\nShe reminds me of the angsty teenage girl who works at my local gas station.

Maybe she didn't have an interest in fashion but like the earlier comment said, she does put in the effort in learning about fashion. She has a lot of input to her look and has a whole vision. She was the one who came up with the concept of 'decaying opulence' and went to JPG with the looks she wanted to reference from their archives. I'm sure Jared helped too but I went to read an interview with him after watching this video and he says the process is very collaborative and she has a very strong vision, opinions and sense of style already.

YouTube don‚Äôt pay as crazy as it used to and for people to literally make money they do need different platforms and also like sharing it to places where other people can garner their eyes to it. TikTok blew up for many reasons but why a lot of people o like it is because it‚Äôs short format and easier for them to keep updated and tune into people‚Äôs lives. Not everyone has the attention span or time to watch long winded YouTube videos which is why YouTube was a niche for awhile and honestly still is because not everyone can do what those youtibers can do and also watch it for that long. That‚Äôs why I think of people who love Money McMichael. She blew up tiktok but was making YouTube a little before that and doesn‚Äôt get as crazy views as TikTok bc sooo many people now prefer the short format. Instagram has always been around lol. Emma also had deleted TikTok for awhile for her mental health too?? So. Idk, maybe I just find it always weird for people to do that. You can tell when things are a cash grab when they‚Äôre not well thought or authentic but considering her YouTube videos are as long as they could be, her tiktoks are silly BTS, Instagram is already what she‚Äôs putting out, and podcasts are her life as well as YouTube.. it makes sense. But I also like the business side of how all this works and I just don‚Äôt think people look at the full picture because of some things.. and you did say it was kinda fake before so I think I was in well meaning in saying the ingenuine part üòÇ",

The verdict has been published online however. Even their legal counsel withdrew after the discovery phase was completed. \n\nTwins Alberto and Mauritz Driz were leaving their 60th birthday party with Mauritz‚Äôs son Shawn and his mate William Joelson. All 4 started abusing the valet leading to a TMZ photographer (I can‚Äôt seem to find their name) trying to intervene leading to all 4 beating into him. The brutality of the attack lead to Anne and Matthew Greene trying to help the photographer. All three were beaten to unconsciousness by these animals. Anne had a fractured skull and broken vertebrae, Matthew had surgery to remove a portion of intestine resulting from the attacks. \n\nImagine what else they‚Äôve gotten away with over the years.\n\nhttps://juryverdictalert.com/assault-and-battery/assault-4-defendants-2-plaintiffs",

She later filmed an \"apology\" saying something within the lines of \"i'm sorry that you felt this way\". I don't think she apologised to the gelateria owner, just the fans.

I like her music, and I actually really liked the podcast that she did in a world of too many unnecessary podcasts, I thought hers was pretty good if a tinge of the weirdness that has gone into her other things like the sex toy and the aliens thing. And I am all for having fun and, sex related deals if you can get them. Christina Aguilera is doing lube ads, and also injectables ads and I‚Äôm a fan of both of them overall.\n\nI feel like this kind of ad is walking a really odd line because with a history of eating disorders and body dysmorphia, and the weight of that on your mental health, and also having been treated terribly by her former team, like that song, Watermelon Cake, it‚Äôs just an odd thing to try and be advertising and selling to others.

        "body": "It wasn't that difficult of a theme and dress code, all you had to do was read the very short story or even a synopsis to make the connection. It was open to interpretation (as the better ones are imo) and let one play with the fragility and ephemeral nature of beauty,  what is progress vs regress, preservation vs degradation, nature vs civilization, the ravages of time, et c. A lot of these exact themes are often metaphorically expressed through gardens. So garden motifs or real florals can share this without trying because its something they already represent, especially the idea that beauty is fleeting. Anything with a butterfly theme also represents it as butterflies are becoming less and less common in our landscape but they also get pinned up as delicate decoration even when they are dead. \n\nI think there were a good percentage of people reasonably on theme /dress code. Some played to the theme by wearing things that looked fragile and/or would not be wearable the same way a second time. Others repurposed old materials that were destroyed in order to create something new or wore echos of pieces lost to time. Others wore things showing (manufactured) signs of wear. I also think a lot of people went the ozymandius route and showed up as some nod to classical statuary too (maybe why all the nude and beige, along with sand references). I would say all those people did follow the dress code and theme in one way or another. And even just the florals and garden party ideas did fit (something from a bygone era) just less interesting. \n\nStill, I did expect a bit more vintage. Letting those things whose time has passed be seen again is like a recipe for spaced repetition. It preserves the memory of fashion in the mind of civilisation even while risking material culture. Especially thought there would be more vintage Mcqueen or nods to him because this kind of gothic/romantic preoccupation was a big part of his work. Alas only a few glimpses of the lost genius. And maybe it's just as well.",

Turns out it was supposed to be fabrics and designs meant to only be worn once because they are so fragile or intricate they'd need to be preserved at the Met after being worn just the once (therefore considered sleeping beauties), and with that, capture the elements of earth, water, and sky. It's also based on a JG Ballard tale where the nature around the characters is so fragile, mostly barren, and impossible to preserve/sustain that it's akin to trying to hold onto sand in your palm: grains will continue to fall out until there's nothing left. Each day, the main character picks a magical crystal flower (the only flowers left in this universe) in his garden to keep an army from approaching and overtaking his villa until there are no flowers left, leaving his garden as barren as the surrounding landscape. It symbolizes a repetitive cycle of mankind's destruction of the natural world/a lack of respect for nature in order to preserve mankind's own interests and desires.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I actually think that's a great theme, but on its face it's very confusing.",

And not any wig, it‚Äôs an 80s Jaclyn Smith hairdo which - just my opinion- is covering too much of her pretty face and looks like a black concrete block encasing her. \nPlus the black gloves to lend credibility to the 80s Stay- at-home mum  gone rocker vibe. \nIt is jarring and not well done. Let me add: The pose makes her look insipid and the dress d√©colletage is not flattering in this picture. \nAnother pic another pose may change this last part. But the ensemble is not up to snuff.",

My assessment and diagnosis was not that far off from an \"armchair diagnosis\" because the psychiatrist, with all of her thirty years experience assessing boys, said that she knew about as much about the female presentation of autism as I did, and asked for the list of books I'd read. So that accusation isn't the gotcha you think it is. \n\nAlso, the harm in armchair diagnoses is when someone oversteps their authority by giving advice to the person.

Very rarely follow that. Off the top of my head - yesterday, a kpop artist (Solar) released a new music video in which she dances with drag performers and flips off the camera; Kard has an entire song about anal (and a discography that's like, 90% sex songs); Mamamoo (specifically the member Solar), BlackPink, and Miss A have pole danced at awards shows; and multiple idols such as RM of BTS, Irene of Red Velvet, and Sooyoung of SNSD have publicized a feminist book which criticizes the gender gap in Korea and is *extremely* controversial among the Korean general public.\n\nIt doesn't matter where you are in the world, people are always going to use music as a way to criticize the world around them.",

Being a tween and young teen in the early 2000s, a tan was a MUST for looking good. (I made one attempt in 2003/2004 at using self tanner. It was followed by a 90 minute shower where I tried to scrub as much of it off as I could‚Äîit‚Äôs a wonder I had any skin left! I remember it was so streaky, my ankles, knees, elbows, knuckles had all absorbed so much product and came out so much darker than everywhere else, and I just generally looked *filthy*.) \n\nBut there‚Äôs Elle being all pale and looking radiant and made of moonlight and it warms my heart. She also wears a lot of colors I would never dream of (cream?ivory?!?) but wears them so well.",

He‚Äôs just got it. \n\nI could see Quinta Brunson having a great look if she‚Äôs with a designer that‚Äôs NOT Siriano. Even though Siriano‚Äôs camp look for Janelle Monae is one of my favorites ever, I don‚Äôt think he has the nuance for this theme and whatever he does is just gonna be a flower explosion. \n\nSpeaking of, Janelle Monae will probably also be on my best dressed list. She just always has a direction, her looks always make a statement. \n\nNicola Coughlan! Another interesting fashion girlie with potential! I think her team has really figured out dressing her body in beautiful and unique ways and I think if she‚Äôs there she could stun me. \n\nBella Hadid - has been absolutely radiant lately, makes me think she‚Äôs gonna absolutely slay today. \n\nWorst dressed guesses:\n\nSelena Gomez. I‚Äôm so sorry girl, I hope to god I‚Äôm wrong. But unlike Nicola Coughlan, I don‚Äôt think anyone knows what to do with Selena. I wish they did, because I think she‚Äôs gorgeous. \n\nHailey Bieber: If I had to guess, she will wear something extremely minimal and not very thematic, which I hate. I bet she will look good but be a total snooze, which is enough to get on my worst dressed list. \n\nIm gonna guess Glen Powell will be there wearing nothing but a simple black tux, snooze. \n\nI‚Äôm gonna guess Daisy Edgar Jones might also wear something very snoozey, even though she‚Äôs gorgeous it just won‚Äôt stun. \n\nAnd I think Billie Eilish might also be a candidate for this I‚Äôm sorry don‚Äôt hate me but even as a host and with all that press I thought she was worst dressed last year (edit: ugh 2022 time freaking flies. Where have the past four years gone). The color was sickly on her and it looked more cosplay than gown.
