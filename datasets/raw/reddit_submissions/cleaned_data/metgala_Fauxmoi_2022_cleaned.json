That negative attention is in fact greater than and more lucrative than positive attention. Whilst I understand that this is an iconic dress, I can’t be bothered to be mad so much as confused about why she chose to do this. The dress was not on theme, as many have stated before- like so far from theme it’s almost as if her and her teams hubris led them to misread or misunderstand the theme. Point two: since the dress was literally custom designed and made for MM how was Kim going to even make it work for her? MM had creamy white skin, Kim has bronze skin- the defining feature of this iconic gown was that it was exactly the color of MM’s skin, and because it was fitted like a glove to the exact measurements of her body, it looked as though MM was nude and covered in crystals on stage. Very risqué and stunning. Point 3, BB if you gotta lose 16 lbs to wear another woman’s dress and it still doesn’t fit…. What did her daddy tell The Juice? “If it don’t fit, you must acquit”? Point 4: KK did ALL this to walk 150 feet and then change into a replica- like why not wear a replica, fitted to your exact measurements and skin color? It would have been far more stunning. Last thing- that her hair people really did her dirty like that, LMFAO. I have watched enough wigTok to know she could have had a beautiful lace front installation that didn’t have her SPRINTING to buy the world’s supply of Olappex and K18. She needs a better team, PERIODT- she is too dumb and uneducated to make decisions on her own.",

It’s a **Vogue** event, and the benefit predates The Costume Institute even joining The Met. Even after it did join, the event was not hosted within the museum for multiple decades.

[That’s them being in a club together in 2011.](https://youtu.be/5QXZeo8-UJ8) I didn't find anything on the net that would support her claim other than them working and hanging out together.\n\n**ROBERT KARDASHIAN (2011-2012)**\n\nIn December 2011 news broke that Rob could be dating Rita. Exactly a year later in December 2012 he went on a Twitter rant that she [allegedly cheated on him with more than 20 men.](https://starcasm.net/rob-kardashian-accuses-ex-rita-ora-of-being-with-20-men-while-dating/) She responded by tweeting at him that his dick was whack and she had to get it somewhere else. He retaliated by claiming [they were expecting at some point](https://heavy.com/news/2012/12/rob-kardashian-rita-ora-pregnant-twee/) but didn’t elaborate on why the pregnancy wasn’t brought to term. [She addressed](https://www.her.ie/celeb/it-wasnt-a-relationship-rita-ora-comes-clean-about-what-happened-with-rob-kardashian-28005)[ it a few months later,](https://www.her.ie/celeb/it-wasnt-a-relationship-rita-ora-comes-clean-about-what-happened-with-rob-kardashian-28005) and while she didn’t deny anything he said, she did say she never deemed them, boyfriend and girlfriend. There were seen hanging out together and posting about each other online, but it was vague enough to potentially believe her claim that they were semi-exclusively hooking up eventually trying to make it work but it never materialized. \n\n**ASAP ROCKY (AUTUMN 2012)**\n\nShe was seen hanging out with him in the autumn of 2012, and he cheated on his then-girlfriend with her. It came to light when he published his album in 2015 [mentioning her](https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/asaprocky/betterthings.html) in the song *Better Things*. [He claims she caused him a lot of trouble with her big mouth](https://thenet.ng/how-aap-rocky-cheated-with-rita-ora-while-in-a-relationship/). He apologized since. She again didn’t deny anything but said she was upset that he gives the impression that it is okay for men to treat women like that.\n\n**CALVIN HARRIS (MAY 2013 - SPRING 2014)**\n\nRita and Calvin historically haven’t had a great rapport based on their Twitter interactions. They had a public back and forth about [her allegedly lying](https://imgur.com/a/TNjS4yJ) about being offered a song. Eventually patching things up and working for the same label [led to him taking her to an event.](https://www.shutterstock.com/de/editorial/image-editorial/daft-punk-random-access-memories-album-playback-party-london-britain-13-may-2013-2334874z) In the following months, they frequently talked about each other or shared stuff on social. Some of his contacts would lead to her biggest hits after they broke up. Calvin, Avicii, and Tiësto would make having Rita as a feature a great staple in EDM music. He was very busy during the time and acquired a home in Los Angeles. Meanwhile, Rita was primarily busy networking and grew closer to Kate Moss. They were hanging out a lot while Rita accompanied Calvin to gigs. He visited her on set when she was filming 50 Shades. There are two stories about *I Will Never Let You Down*. Rita claims [they came up with it together](https://www.songfacts.com/facts/rita-ora/i-will-never-let-you-down). Calvin firmly stated [he wrote that song](https://youtu.be/uzAC0Gr7Z-Q?t=127). (They both have been on Ryan Seacrest after the split talking about it so you can watch [her visit first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6xwhCREA94) and his visit afterward.) However, they recorded the song together and made their red carpet debut in January 2014. After it was published rumors started to break that their relationship might be a little rocky. [Allegedly he wasn't happy with her ripping Zac Efrons shirt off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8TKRNPSIuc) in April while he was doing Coachella. They eventually went on a break after getting together at *Radio 1’s Big Weekend* at the end of May and Calvin informed the world, including Rita, via Twitter by early June that they had broken up a while ago. By that time he had contributed four more songs for her upcoming album. Rumors spread the reason for the split was her cheating on him, while she maintained it was due to their busy schedules. [One story claims](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2660125/Rita-Ora-makes-feelings-known-offensive-motif-jumper-claimed-Calvin-Harris-dumped-secret-visit-LA.html) she stayed in a hotel in LA without telling him. [Others claimed](https://perezhilton.com/rita-ora-touchy-feely-with-justin-bieber-before-calvin-harris-breakup/) she was flirting with Justin Bieber. The split however seemed amicable until August, when Rita [was supposed to perform at the Teen Choice Awards](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/aug/13/rita-ora-calvin-harris-blocked-teen-choice-award-performance) and put her own money into the performance until Calvin didn’t approve it a day prior. They then started to become a little cryptic about the split, giving each other backhanded compliments. He alluded to having very good reasons for the split and pointing at her determination to be successful, claiming she will be around longer than most. She called him out multiple times for the *Teen Choice Awards* saying she has no idea why he did that. He also wouldn't let her use the songs they/he wrote for her album. They were both signed at RocNation and allegedly Rita wanted RN to force Calvin to let her record the songs but RN sided with him. Ultimately one of the reasons leading to Rita suing RN. Calvin went on to work with multiple ppl Rita has an issue with. Rihanna who allegedly sabotaged Rita at RocNation and Dua Lipa who Rita is feuding. Both songs were significantly more successful. \n\n# CONNECTIONS WITH EVIDENCE BUT UNCONFIRMED\n\n**CARA DELEVINGNE (Somewhere 2012-2013)**\n\nCara and Rita started being seen out together in the summer of 2012 surrounded by their party entourage. Over the years they always seemed close and [played with the narrative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am-KOgCCmL4) of them actually hooking up. [Calling each other wifey.](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/event/article-2325462/Rita-Ora-Cara-Delevingne-I-taken-market.html) [Or Cara putting up a show with her on stage.](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2340610/Cara-Delevingne-joins-wifey-Rita-Ora-stage-dirty-dancing--resist-showcasing-vocals-well.html) But in the end, she posted similar pics with many girlfriends (including Cara’s sister Poppy) and never showed more affection than some female friends do. Years later Rita still didn’t confirm anything. [She claims the relationship was ‘ambiguous](https://www.music-news.com/news/UK/105895/Rita-Ora-talks-ambiguous-relationship-with-Cara-Delevingne)[’.](https://www.music-news.com/news/UK/105895/Rita-Ora-talks-ambiguous-relationship-with-Cara-Delevingne) She also claims they started a trend. I don’t know what she means by that, but it came up when she came out with the song *Girls* in 2018. She claimed this song is not about anything more than supporting other females, [despite the lyrics telling a different story](https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ritaora/girls.html). But once the song received backlash for exploiting being bisexual as something you can appropriate to cater to the male gaze and cause controversy without any stigma that might come with it the narrative changed. Ora then claimed that it was actually telling her story of being bisexual herself and that she had romantic relationships with other women and [was now forced to come out bc ppl were questioning her.](https://www.songfacts.com/facts/rita-ora/girls) \n\n**DAVE GARDNER (2013)**\n\nThey were seen a lot together in 2013 which is not unusual per se bc they shared the same circles. They [hung out overnight](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2281084/Rita-Ora-leaves-Dave-Gardners-house-wearing-SAME-outfit-night-partying-storm-LFW-bash.html). They [were seen out and about](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2309931/Rita-Ora-steps-David-Beckhams-best-friend-Dave-Gardner-days-Vegas-break-Luke-Magill.html) picking stuff up. Some mystical sources revealed they were having something. And then there is [the Calvin Harris incident](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2492799/Rita-Ora-spotted-ex-Dave-Gardner-shortly-posting-I-miss-baby-picture-boyfriend-Calvin-Harris.html). He wasn’t seen with her afterward (except for rare bump-ins) and not since he started dating Liv Tyler.\n\n**LUKE MAGNILL (APRIL 2013)**\n\n[Both were seen cozying up at a pool in Las Vegas coming and leaving together.](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2305740/Rita-Ora-canoodles-new-beau-derriere-view.html) Looks a little bit too intimate to be a just friends situation. They also weren’t seen together afterward. \n\n# CONNECTIONS WITH NO EVIDENCE OR HAVE BEEN DENIED\n\n**DRAKE (ALLEGEDY 2012)**\n\nDrake wrote her song R.I.P. and she spoke positively about him. There are a few pics of them hanging out, but nothing that would justify assuming they hooked up other than their dating habits in general. She also denied it publicly. \n\n**JONAH HILL (ALLEGEDLY 2012)**\n\n[A couple of blinds went around](https://www.digitalspy.com/showbiz/a446891/rita-ora-cheated-on-rob-kardashian-with-jonah-hill/) claiming Rita cheated on Rob with Jonah Hill, who bragged about it, which was the final straw for Rob. I couldn’t find anything other that would support that claim. Also, CDAN is involved who has a hate boner for her.\n\n**EVAN ROSS (JANUARY 2013)**\n\n[Rita was spotted making out with him at Goldbar in SoHo.](https://www.ibtimes.com/rita-ora-kisses-evan-ross-nightclub-she-moves-rob-kardashian-1001554) Both of them had been single at that time and are friends to this day. They have been spotted numerous times together during that time and ever since. The timeline and location make sense. Kissing someone is not that big of a deal. Neither of them commented on it. \n\n**SNOOP DOG (ALLEGEDLY JANUARY 2013)**\n\n[They went together to Thailand](https://www.celebdirtylaundry.com/2013/rita-ora-snoop-dogg-sex-affair-sleeping-together-thailand-twitter-photos-0116/) which made ppl think they are an item, but they were just shooting the [(unintentionally funny) music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6jsWWo2_1M) for a collab. \n\n**JAY-Z** (Allegedly somewhere between 2012-2015)\n\nRita was signed with Roc Nation when she was 18 years old in December of 2008. After her first attempt at making an album was scrapped by the label, she finally published her debut in 2012. Prior to all the scandals. No rumors gained track up until late 2012 or early 2013 after Rob Kardashian blasted her on Twitter for allegedly cheating and promiscuous behavior. [Holly Hagan claimed she heard Rita was having an affair with Jay-Z.](https://www.celebdirtylaundry.com/2013/jay-z-beyonce-cheating-rita-ora-holly-hagan-0103/) Ppl went wild afterward. [To give you an impression of ](https://theboxhouston.com/8851412/friend-tells-beyonce-jay-z-secrets/)[how wild claims became.](https://theboxhouston.com/8851412/friend-tells-beyonce-jay-z-secrets/) Rita publicly denied it. Her comments on the label were positive and based on the PR the label provided her and [her statements made](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/apr/12/rita-ora-jay-z) it didn’t seem like the relationship was strained due to the rumors. \n\nIn 2013 she also started dating Calvin Harris and they worked together professionally. She was also featured on Iggy Azaleas US top 10 hit *Black Widow* which marks her first positive appearance on the US market. However, her private life started affecting her work life. She had a nasty breakup with CH who was also signed to RN and one of their highest earners. She wanted RN to force CH to let her publish the songs they wrote together but instead made her restart her album production. [Allegedly she was also feuding with Rihanna.](https://www.thethings.com/this-is-why-fans-think-rihanna-doesnt-get-along-with-rita-ora/) Rihanna would block songs for herself so Rita couldn’t record them. Meanwhile, Rita would record a song with her ex Chris Brown. Rita recorded *I Will Never Let You Down* with CH and later Rihanna would release the way more successful *This Is What You Came For* with him. During the summer of 2015, Rita claimed her next album would come by the end of 2015 instead she sued RN to release her of the contract. They countersued for breaking her contract. They settled in May 2016. \n\nHaving that timeline in mind, Beyoncé dropped *Lemonade* in April 2016 with the infamous *Sorry* track, having the cheating rumors with Rita flare up again. So in the middle of the lawsuit and the press she was getting, [Rita felt inclined to Snapchat](https://www.unilad.co.uk/music/rita-ora-responds-to-rumours-she-had-an-affair-with-jay-z)[a a ](https://www.unilad.co.uk/music/rita-ora-responds-to-rumours-she-had-an-affair-with-jay-z)[picture of her in a lemon bra with a J necklace.](https://www.unilad.co.uk/music/rita-ora-responds-to-rumours-she-had-an-affair-with-jay-z) Just to turn around and clear the rumors that she of course isn’t Becky with the good hair. [In May she also posted a ‘selfie’ with Beyoncé at the MET gala calling her family.](https://www.vogue.com/article/beyonce-rita-ora-met-gala-2016-selfie) Shortly afterwards they settled the lawsuit. There are no really notable get-togethers recorded after Rita was released from her contract. Beyoncé congratulates her on her birthday on her website but she isn’t invited to events like their Oscar party. Even though rumors around them went wild and stepped onto conspiracy theory territory, I wouldn’t go as far as deem anything proof. \n\n**Concluding remarks:** As you may know, I am a frequent contributor to the DM subreddit. It became a running gag that I gathered random RO knowledge during the pandemic, and I started a weekly update on her. I included TW bc they are attached to the hips. I wasn’t aware of how controversial TW is in the gossip world up until I started doing this, comments and direct messages were flooding in. While this for sure seems excessive, it simply has been gathered over years of being exposed to European yellow press and reading up stuff whenever I felt like it. I neither stan nor hate Rita. Huge fan of her fashion. Don’t mind her music. Think she is an amazing hustler. Also think she is problematic af. I wrote up a couple of these breakdowns while watching *The Dropout.* It is not that serious. Gossipculture is nothing else than playing *Dungeons & Dragons* with celebrities. We do gossip, not facts. So please don’t send me crazy messages claiming I am obsessed with RO bc it makes you look obsessed with me. If you wish for other deep dives on that topic or rumored relationships of her that I didn’t pick up yet pls leave me a comment.\n\n**The next deep dives will include**: Justin Bieber, Ricky Hill, Chris Brown, Whiz Khalifa, Travis Barker, Fai Khadra, James Arthur, Lewis Hamilton, Andrew Watt, Tyrone Wood, Brooklyn Peltz Beckham, Conor McGregor, Andrew Garfield, Rafferty Law, Jude Law, Joey Essex, Romain Gavras, Taika Waititi",

I was just ignoring it the first two days, and then realized I have to start blocking ppl if I don't want that stuff in my notifications or derail my other contributions. Unfortunately, ppl don't get that they could simply block me to not see my stuff. Others unblock me to be able to comment on my posts, then block me again, so I can't respond. So I had to go through ppl following me or posting under my stuff and kick them out of my feed, which is a little time-consuming and made me procrastinate the other two posts.

She doesn't have a majorly successful album four times in a decade or a blockbuster out every year. If you are constantly at parties with celebs who actively pursue you bc you are fun, attractive, and overlook assholes, she is pretty much the number one target group for celebs. I answered a couple of other posts here explaining her background of experiencing abuse and being exploited by men and the media, and if you look at what kind of mega-celebrities went after her, there are a bunch of questionable characters and serial cheaters in there. So I do think she is being pursued as much as she is pursuing. She also became famous pretty young and never had longer relationships, most of them being long-distance. There is a reason that Taika and her are being together for such a long time. They are spending almost every day together and were only separated 2-3 times since February 2021, and he is 15 years her senior. She is not very experienced in relationships, just experienced in dating around.",

If you like acoustics and want to hear her voice try her [acoustic playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6EYuNtoBL2NBH2PqloIvsA?si=94da9e1a53e24561). I consider many of her songs overproduced, so most ppl don't know she can sing. My personal fave is her [Bang EP](https://open.spotify.com/album/63Lx86ejgS5hQfbazyDibY?si=ZDlTJEdXTOG68jxBF4cYMg).",

There are a couple of key ppl that are the ringleaders and Rita meets up with them. Her whole family likes their posts and reposts (incl. Rita) their fan videos etc on their socials. Rita also includes them in friends-only Instagram stories. They stream her music excessively and report negative posts to her team. Rita usually gets around 300-600 comments on her posts that are not excessively sexy and 50 of those are usually ritabots doing five posts each. They consider her a lifesaver, the best vocalist of our time and an admirable activist. The narrative is absolutely delusional.",

Bollywood heroines generally are told to give a much more ‘subdued’ image: many top actresses give very rehearsed non-answers to every single question. Whereas PC 💀. You either like her personality or hate it, she comes off annoying and preachy. \n\n\nShe also gets a lot of hate for having an affair with one of the biggest (married) superstars in India, SRK. I find that also strange since it wasn’t the first time SRK had an affair, but they were very loud about it and hurt her in Bollywood because SRK’s wife (and the producers on her side) were furious. \n\nPC is also an outsider: nepotism is a big problem in industries like Bollywood that are smaller, and so they were all too happy to kick PC out of roles she deserved. \n\n PC is easily extremely talented. She has taken garbage roles on in America, but in India she was the most talented out of the top actresses. She portrayed an autistic person extremely well in an industry with a lot of horrific portrayals, did the biopic of Mary Kom (Indian boxer), was an amazing villain..etc. \n\nShe’s a way better actress than Nick is at singing tbf. \n\nI think she’s probably lost now, yes she made the transition into Hollywood when she was very hated in India but now she’s hated in 2 countries pretty much. I hope she can do well with her future projects. \n\nShe needs to fire her PR team and get a good role in something.",

Let’s go along what happened to some actresses: \n\nMadhubala: Father abused her, alcoholic throughout life, beaten every day, died early of a heart defect \n\nRati: Left her top career to get married to a man who beat for 60 years. It didn’t matter that she was the one earning for the family, an actress was a bad thing and she had to submit to her husband\n\nRekha: Was forced on films as a child, was the illegitimate daughter of a famous actor but was dirt poor. Abused sexually since age 13. When she got married she was considered bad luck bcz she was a ‘manglik’- born during Mars. Her husband committed suicide after the wedding, and they didn’t blame his depression, they blamed her. \n\nYou get the idea, the top actors married women they could manipulate and had affairs(Dimple Kapadia was 15 when she got married) \n\nThe 90s was when Bollywood ruled. Many of the best loved actresses come from there. But most of them got married to cheating husbands..etc. Aishwarya Rai, considered the most beautiful woman in the world was beaten by the superstar Salman Khan and was blamed for it. \n\nBut now, in the 2000s, surprisingly actresses have more lasting power. Madhuri Dixit is in her 50s but is still well loved. For the first time, actresses are considered people. And there’s a lot of people unhappy about that. \n\nPriyanka, Deepika, Alia and more have been ushering in a new era. They aren’t perfect- many of the top actresses have done stupid things, been cruel publicly but there’s a reason they get hated on in particular.",

Suddenly this old dress nobody particularly cared about anymore is the talk of the town, that’s a win for Ripley’s.\n\nReality is:\n\nMarilyn Monroe was a unique personality who was famous for her beauty and fashion, she had middling talent at best and mostly made her name by being beautiful and setting up great PR moments.\n\nKim Kardashian is a unique personality who is famous for her beauty and fashion, she also has minimal talent but while she too mostly makes her name by being beautiful and setting up great PR moments she has also built a mega fashion and beauty empire off the back of her fame and frequently uses her wealth and influence to help people in need.\n\nArguably, Kim is a far greater success and more decent human being than Marilyn ever was, if you really want to split hairs.\n\nAnd while I’m not remotely interested in slut-shaming…\n\nMost of the commentary around this whole thing has been insults about Kim shitting on Marilyn’s “legacy” or not caring about Marilyn’s wishes etc etc etc but:\n\nKim: banged zero other people’s husbands.\n\nMarilyn: banged at least four people’s husbands that we know of.\n\nWhy are we raising Marilyn up to be this angel who is so much worthier than Kim when she was really not a super great human, lived a messy life riddled with poor judgment and ultimately died a premature death having overdosed because she was such an unhappy person.\n\nIn this day and age we have a great deal more compassion for the mental health struggles she no doubt experienced, but in context of comparing her to Kim it’s pretty bloody insulting and frankly misogynistic to suggest Marilyn had far greater value as a human than Kim does.\n\nMarilyn is long dead but let’s use a different “older woman” celebrity as an example, Cher. Cher thinks highly of Kim, is proper friends with her, has willingly worked with her and is genuinely flattered by Kim’s admiration of her. Kim has bought Cher pieces and worn them and has dressed up as her on more than one occasion and Cher bloody loves it!\n\nMy guess is that if Marilyn was around she’d probably like Kim and be honoured she wanted to wear her dress.\n\nTruth is, if Kim could have bought the dress to wear it she probably would have, but she settled for renting it out with the blessing of the people who do own it…\n\n… who were the ones who put her in it on the night and hence *are responsible for any damage to THE DRESS THAT THEY OWN.*\n\nI’m no Kim K fan but all this nonsense around this subject is so steeped in misogyny and other such ugliness and I’m tired of this bullshit idea that Marilyn is some perfect angel and Kim some selfish devil or any other such narrative that insinuates this stupid dress is somehow of immense value.\n\nIt’s a piece of old fabric that sits in a for-profit museum who were more than happy that a highly successful woman wanted to take it out for a spin and enhance its value.\n\nLet’s stop pretending this is anything else and stop subscribing to the misogynistic narrative at hand.",

Obviously it was a playful tweet 'cause Hailey was a teenager and we all have done that shit. No judgment Hailey, I would do that too.\n\nAnd here's Shawn's reply[https://twitter.com/ShawnMendes/status/397147228776964096](https://twitter.com/ShawnMendes/status/397147228776964096)\n\nNow we know that both of them are aware of each others existence.\n\nNow, moving forward I have this masterpiece for you all. ***All credits for this beautiful collection goes to the original blogger.***\n\n[https://harrystylesandblackgirls.tumblr.com/post/184818507575/hey-new-anon-here-which-tweets-did-shawn-post](https://harrystylesandblackgirls.tumblr.com/post/184818507575/hey-new-anon-here-which-tweets-did-shawn-post)\n\nSo, now we know that Shawn and Hailey both were invested in each other and Hailey went with Shawn to his hometown in Canada.\n\n[https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/5204667/shawn-mendes-and-hailey-baldwin-spend-a-romantic-day-in-toronto-as-they-go-public-with-their-romance/](https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/5204667/shawn-mendes-and-hailey-baldwin-spend-a-romantic-day-in-toronto-as-they-go-public-with-their-romance/)\n\nSo, it's pretty solid that something is def going on between Shawn and Hailey since late 2017, at least.\n\n[https://www.girlfriend.com.au/hailey-baldwin-and-shawn-mendes-flirting](https://www.girlfriend.com.au/hailey-baldwin-and-shawn-mendes-flirting)\n\nMeanwhile Shawn and Hailey were in Canada going all cutesy on each other Selena and Justin had landed themselves in Couples therapy.

Good on him for that but I don't believe that saying sorry would land him in couple's therapy.\n\nKeep in mind that Hailey and Justin share the same immediate circle of friends. Kendall and Kylie are Hailey's bestfriends and Jaden and Hailey are very good friends too. So, obviously it's not like they are firmly no contact. At least in a platonic way and know about each other.

Don't get me started on the Drake drama 'cause that's another can of worms.

The articles say that she took the picture down fast but others have let me know that it was up for some time. I tried digging but it's unclear what exactly happened. This part is quite messy so, yeah)\n\nSources claim that they are on break and by may, Sel and Justin are **officially** over for good. So, Justin been lowkey single since late feb-early march. This is an important part of the timeline 'cause Hailey later mentioned that both Justin and she had been single for sometime before getting hitched.[https://www.eonline.com/news/1209557/hailey-bieber-clarifies-the-timeline-of-her-and-justin-biebers-relationship](https://www.eonline.com/news/1209557/hailey-bieber-clarifies-the-timeline-of-her-and-justin-biebers-relationship)\n\nNow, may is here and it's the time for the met gala 2018 baby!

Something must have happened around here  between Shawn and Hailey 'cause by June Hailey and Justin are seen together going to church and making out in NY.  Maybe they broke off whatever it was and decided to be just friends. Sights.\n\nShawn release particular taste and has Hailey reference:\n\nShe don't listen to a thing 'less it feels right  \nOnly dances when ***it's Kanye***\n\nHailey in 2016 dancing to a Kanye song [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L59zGgIOCaQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L59zGgIOCaQ)\n\nalso, she mentioned in her 73 questions with vogue that anything with Kanye is perfect for runway.\n\nNow. July is here and it's chaos all over. Grab your seats folks 'cause it's gonna go weird.\n\n***July 8,2018:*** Justin and Hailey are officially engaged.

A lot of 13 year olds are left heartbroken.\n\nThe year comes to an end and Shawn finally admits that he was romantically involved with the now Mrs. Bieber but in a state of limbo. [https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a25306003/shawn-mendes-on-dating-hailey-baldwin/](https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a25306003/shawn-mendes-on-dating-hailey-baldwin/)\n\nSo, there we go! That was weird and messy. I'm still shipping Kendall and Hailey 'cause that the true ship worth shipping! Also, I did not include the Bella/Abel/Selena drama going on along with this 'cause the timeline is already fucked up. That one is a lore in it's own. \n\nSince, this is the end. I'll give you this cute picture of Bella, Gigi, Kendall and Hailey! [https://in.pinterest.com/pin/586101339018730810/](https://in.pinterest.com/pin/586101339018730810/)",

But I think they would get more promotion creating something to the theme. Like that’s what is fun about fashion, creating something inspired by another era or time. To me it just shows designers just care even more about money and a lot of these celebrities have no vision or taste",

The dress code was just \"Gilded Glamour and White Tie\" so everyone who was disappointed that people weren't in a specific era's costuming or \"not on theme\" were probably taking the event too literally. It's not required to dress on \"theme\" and Gilded Glamour can be interpreted differently. \n\nI follow a lot of fashion journalists on twitter and it is intersting to see how they react each year vs a place like this.

If that's true it would be crazy to transition out of crush/eye candy/boyfriend territory to this pseudo family / business relationship. Like how do you navigate those conversations?",

    "selftext": "- This weekend, Academy CEO and president held a big presentation on the future of the Oscars broadcast. \n\n\n- Matt Belloni at Puck News reached out to see what members thought the presentation by new Academy C.E.O. Bill Kramer and president Janet Yang, most hadn’t even bothered to check out the rare all-member meeting. “You must have mistaken me for someone who cares,” one responded to my email. “Not for me, wish them well,” said a producer via text. “On a Saturday morning? Lecturing is for church,” said an exec. “Kids soccer!” \n\n\n- He said the few people he spoke to who did attend were impressed. Leadership seems a lot more transparent than previous years.\n\n\n- Only 20 percent of members felt positive about this year’s Oscars, down from 61 percent in 2019, Kramer revealed. With the addition of the Academy Museum, the Oscars now represent 75 percent of the group’s operating revenue, down from 90 percent, with a goal of reducing its dependence even further (though big bond payments on the museum are looming). \n\n\n- Belloni cites the Academy's unwillingness to change and evolve as a major factor in declining ratings. \n“Reinvigorate the Oscars” and “Evolve our brand” were revealed as explicit goals of the organization. He says this is especially important bc the Academy never acknowledges this to members: \"Everyone has either been in denial about the Oscars crisis, defiant about the purpose of the show, or simply unwilling to change for the long-term relevance of the organization.\"\n\n\n- They also presented an 8-prong plan for the future to include: hiring tv producers to run the show, focus on love for film, find way to properly honor all categories, promote emotional investment in nominees, explore streaming, solidify theatrical release requirement, make the red carpet an event on scale of Met Gala,  and continue to promote sustainability and inclusion.\n\n\n- Interesting tea: \"The “accountable to the Academy” part is also a big deal, because for years the leadership essentially threw up its hands when the show was bad. Not our fault, the producers are in control. Last year, Will Packer finished the telecast and took off for the Vanity Fair party, leaving the Academy to deal with the Will Smith mess without insight or accountability from the lead producer. ABC was livid.\"\n\n\n- Belloni goes into more detail on the 8-prong plan and you can read those at the link below, but the Met Gala approach is interesting: \"The Oscars would be wise to own that avenue—a West Coast Met Gala with more Leo DiCaprios, fewer Pete Davidsons—rather than seemingly being embarrassed about the glamor element. Engaging Met Gala creative consultants Lisa Love and Raul Àvila is a good start toward that goal.\"\n\n\n- On the Old Guard Academy members: \"Kramer seems to get that he needs to balance the inclusion concerns with those who think the pendulum has shifted too far.\"\n\n\nhttps://puck.news/the-oscars-may-go-down-fighting/",

Why is it that they only get recognition in the International Feature Film category, outside of one foreign film they choose every year to get nominated in more categories?

The films are sent to them, and they couldn't be bothered to watch the other films. They let Frozen win because it was popular! And each year, they seem to disrespect animation more and more. Why? You guys do realize that the people who worked on those films are going to watch the Oscars right? Why are you insulting them?\n\nThen, there is how they're so willing to protect godawful people. Will Smith slaps a man and he's banned for ten years but Roman Polsanki still gets to keep his Oscar? Really? They want to be more modern and inclusive but they're not actively trying to expel the garbage within the Academy? Seriosuly? \n\nThe Oscars don't feel genuine anymore.

And I don't want them to nominate more Marvel shit, this is not the point but there are whole genres like horror or more straight up comedy that get ignored. There are rare cases like Jordan Peele but it's more of exception than anything.\n\nLike Miss Flo should have been nominated for best actress in Midsommar because this is the movie she left a mark with and that was a superior performance. Ari should have been nominated for that or Hereditary or both. Not nominating Villeneuve last year was a fucking robbery.\n\nAs a whole audiences don't care because the movies they nominate are kinda niche and putting a Black Panther in there doesn't solve the problem.\n\n There are also many great directors like Nolan or Fincher who keep getting robbed for the sake of far inferior directors with less imagination just because they make more Oscar baity movies. Like how could that dude whose name I cannot even remember win with that King movie over the Social Network for direction??\n\nLike unless DDL decides to come out of retirement I don't and get his 4th leading actor win, I don't see anyone watching it.",

        "body": "The Oscars work (when they work) for 2 reasons. First, people get invested in artists they support and want that support to be validated in the form of awards in this case. They could adjust who gets to vote or the voting rules until they end up with a system that rewards who people most want to be rewarded. Frankly, I'm not sure a system like that perfectly exists, but there are some fairly simple things that would improve this probably vis-a-vis the (lack) of diversity in the voters/winners. \n\nSecond, the Oscars sells a vision of fame that is both glamorously out of reach and accessible to anyone. There's an underlying implication - if you make the best art, people will notice and you will be rewarded. I'd compare this to meritocratic premise of professional sports: \"if you can play well enough you'll make it.\" This isn't really true in either case, but it's more obviously true with movies, and that's more obviously true in the era of the internet and democratization of information. We can see the politics behind it all and the lack of diversity. So my suggestion is to gamify the awards, especially some of the lesser known ones. Maybe push back the Oscars date, but cover the nominees the way sportscenter breaks down sports highlights. Cover what makes something a good nominee for \"best visual effects\" or \"best animated short.\" On some level the Oscars have to convince people again that they really are showing the best of the best, or else none of it works. Whether it's my totally bullshit very inane idea or something else.",

We can't just say \"nominate movies people actually see\" because by in large, people aren't watching new movies in theaters the same way. I agree the internet plays a big role in this with monoculture disappearing (unless it's an IP, we aren't all talking about the same movies), streaming on the rise (especially when the price of a ticket could buy you a month's worth of shows/movies on a streamer) and as you said, we can all see the best parts of the ceremony the next day, so why sit through all of it?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm a little more optimistic that the Oscars can turn it around, not to the level of the 00s and 90s, but if they actually treat the event as an appreciation of film seriously (don't pretape the technical awards) and somehow get celebrities to show up to the ceremony again (even people that were in the nominated movies didn't show up) to appease casual viewers",

While I don’t doubt that many are genuine advocates for climate change or women’s rights or anti-racism or whatever, it just feels like there is more and more of a disconnect between watching someone stand in a several thousand dollar outfit on a stage that costs more than an average home and see them get kudos for saying the bare minimum from others who are in similar financial positions. \n\nPart of the disconnect stems from the fact that I feel like many of the celebrities are trying to portray and “us against them” type mentality, where they aren’t part of the establishment that is complicit in harming society. It feels hypocritical. I think we’ve all gotten very disillusioned with celebrity culture since the beginning of the pandemic, and what was previously seen as endearing is now eye-roll worthy. \n\nI think it is important for public figures to use their platform for good, but there’s a part of me that thinks it is so disingenuous that I just want them to stop mentioning anything except the art. \n\nMaybe I’m more cynical than I used to be, but it II just get this feeling of disdain now when celebs use their platform at the Oscar’s to speak on issues when they are an active part of an industry that exploits women and drives ageism in society, props up predators, wreaks havoc on the earth and contributes to climate change on a scale that is incomparable to most individual citizens, reinforces negative stereotypes about minorities, and has to force themselves to maintain the facade of inclusion without taking truly meaningful steps towards diversity. \n\nWhich sucks because I used to love the Oscars. I would print out all the nominees when I was younger (and before that when I had crappy dial-up internet, I would get a copy of Entertainment Weekly which had all the nominees listed), and I’d mark who I wanted to win, who I thought would win, and who actually won, and then I’d cut out pictures of all the pretty dresses I liked best in the tabloids from the following days.",
