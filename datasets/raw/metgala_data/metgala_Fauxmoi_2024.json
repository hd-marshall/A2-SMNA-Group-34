For a couple years around 2020 it seemed like Kim was shifting into a new direction—law and social justice—and I thought that was the perfect move, both for her “brand” and the world. But in the last 2 years especially they’ve seemed to double down on the vanity and the excessive displays of wealth and wastefulness, which most of the world is just pretty repulsed by at this point. I’m 38, so seeing Kim and Khloe desperately trying to hang on to their youth is just depressing. I would have loved to have seen them become more confident in themselves as they aged but instead they seem to be regressing and it’s just uncomfortable to watch them change their faces and bodies every month.",

I’m not a lawyer well versed in these types of contracts (the op who posted on the Kardashians sub was though I believe). \n\nI couldn’t imagine that, especially as the brand has lost its status.

        "body": "Given that JLo’s fashion is responsible for the creation of Google Images (the Versace dress), I think this is a much-deserved title for her. I wouldn’t have her at the top of my list currently for fashion, but historically she’s made a HUGE impact. Her style is always evolving, she’s not afraid to push boundaries with big hats or metallic fabrics, and she always looks chic and sharp. \n\nZendaya is definitely in my top 3 fashion stars right now, probably slot 1 or 2. A queen. She has been a huge influence in the recent trend of movie stars making their red carpet fashion match the vibes of the movie they’re promoting. Timothee C has credited her with this as well. \n\nBad bunny also wears a lot of exciting looks. He frequently wears more feminine styles such as his 2022 met gala look which featured a suit skirt and updo, or his music video featuring him in a red latex mini skirt. I love to see shifting gender norms in fashion. It’s so rare to see him in a plain black suit it actually becomes interesting when he does. \n\nChris hemsworth is.. well uh… he tries to… his style is very… um…",

Anna Wintour acts as a facilitator and a mediator bringing the museum and Vogue together to create the gala. She doesn’t choose the theme as it is chosen by the Met and the exhibition they are highlighting on a certain year. It’s mainly a collaboration of art and fashion \n\nThe Gala is meant to raise money for the museum and the exhibitions, whereas, I don’t know if Vogue World is just going to be another fancy Soho House meet up\n\nAll in all, I don’t know what it’s about",

I haven’t read much about it but I think it’s been linked to the met by Anna wintour and Vogue to try to bring some publicity to it as it’s only in its second year. What I have seen says that it’s a celebration of British performing arts, will have Ian McKellen, Victoria Beckham, London mayor Khan, Stormzy and is being overseen by Stephen Daldry (Billy Elliott director) with some profits going to British Opera House, Royal Ballet etc. so it seems like it is more aimed at British culture I guess? The first vogue world was in NYC last year so the next will probably be Paris or Milan or another big fashion week city.\nI do wish it was a stand alone thing though.

These are freelancers, assistants, and producers who work tirelessly starting months before events like the Met Gala but receive no spotlight or recognition for their work. It’s the universal Condé experience on an even larger, more intense scale, proving that there would be no @condenast—or Met Gala—without us.\n\n>Overwork, but no Overtime—Making the Met Gala takes hours of extra work from the entire @voguemagazine team, not to mention other employees throughout the company. Yet Condé believes that prestige is enough to cover the incredible amounts of unpaid labor. If we do a job, we deserve to get paid for it, even if it is something as incredible as the Met Gala.\n\n>24/7 with no breaks—Events may end at a certain time, but that doesn’t mean the work ends. With events like the Met Gala, the Oscars, the Grammys, and more, the all-night news coverage and viral video moments come from somewhere—the computers of hard-working writers, video editors, and social media managers who have to stay up until the early hours to bring you content. Burnout is endemic to Condé Nast, and events like these do nothing but make it worse.",

The expectation for the outfits having to do with theme comes from people online that have nothing to do with the actual gala other than commenting on it from home. Designers pay a lot of money to have a table because it’s exposure for the brand. They are there to show off their designs and if the theme does not fit with their design identity and style they’re probably are not going to incorporate it.

Kris never seemed to lean into Kim to do the show either at that time. \n\nAnyhow, Kim is Kris's favorite and that's always put her at odds with Kourt. There's a bit of misdirected anger from Kourt towards Kim over this (and some stuff that Kim's rightly done like slap the shit out of her). \n\nI don't watch the show anymore and haven't for years.
