Crew had been there since noon for a scene at 1pm. At 7pm we’re all chilling, watching The Wire on our phones and shit in the guest house. Producer gets a call.\n\n“Okay… right… okay… but, you’re on board now? Great.”\n\nHangs up and tells and us that our star just pulled up to the PJ in Miami and will he home in 2 hours. Took them 4 hours to finally roll up for a 15m pickup scene in their driveway, wrapping about 10m before we’d hit OT.\n\nSame artist we covered a music video shoot that had really just gotten started after midnight.

Tristan Thompson too. \n\nI don’t have a mirror to look into their lives and see the truth. Maybe Kim is nicer than I’m thinking. But then since they control the media they would say “Kim is still friends with Kanye” or “Kim is the best for supporting her struggling ex husband”. \n\nKanye is an adult, albeit a childish one. IIRC he loved Kim right way, pursued her, wooed her. He made several songs about her and they’re the main characters in the Bound 2 video.\n\nAll the men in their lives are adults with free will, they know who the women are and what the deal is. They’re willing participants in the Kardashian saga until they want out. Look at Pete D and what he’s said about it.",

Kim Kardashian wanted the approval of Anna Wintour and the fashion world. She was upset no one would dress her the year she was only Kanye West's plus one. And she's been professional and done everything to maintain that connection. Compare that to Kendall Jenner opting not to walk fashion shows too soon after being invited to them, or Kylie Jenner repeatedly cancelling opportunities to promote Kylie Cosmetics on TV Shows and on fashion runways, or Kourtney saying she put no thought into her outfit the only year her and Khloe were invited. Kris Jenner knows Kim Kardashian is her client to use to maintain the fashion world relationship.\n\nKanye West from his sexual harassment to his white supremacist views has proven too unstable to collaborate with. Whereas the success of SKIMMS has placed Kim as a valuable asset in her own right.

Kris Jenner knows Kim Kardashian is her client to use to maintain the fashion world relationship.\n\nVery true.\n\n>Whereas the success of SKIMMS has placed Kim as a valuable asset in her own right. \n\nI still can't believe people are buying it but that's the power of good advertising.

He admitted to headbutting her but called it ‘accidental’. This admission was a big contrast to his statement that he had never injured Amber. It was wild to see his supporters in the US try to prove Amber created the bruises on those pics herself, when Depp previously admitted they were indeed bruises.\n\n[Court of Appeal - hearing video](https://www.youtube.com/live/cpBPinGmqNI?si=SA_7kCUZnW8EiPH6) \\-  gives a good impression of evidence against Depp. I watched this hearing to request appeal on a livestream at the time, the case itself was not broadcasted but [transcripts](https://leaveheardalone.com/witness-statements) are available.\n\nA good summary for anyone who would like to learn more is this legal doc, very clear timeline and overview of evidence: [Final judgement UK](https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Judgment-FINAL.pdf) 📚",

His texts to Amber about Johnny kicking her and apologizing for it, also confirmed he witnessed the abuse. House manager Kevin Murphy admitted in court the dog had serious health problems and they were about to hire one of Cesar Milan’s trainers for the pooping issue…the judge didn’t believe it was likely the prank story happened and Depp admitted there was a ‘lavatorial streak’ in his sense of humor ([page 100](https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Judgment-FINAL.pdf)). Depp used that false story to dehumanize Amber, humiliate her and a lot of his supporters still repeat this lie to discredit her.\n\nHouse manager Ben King confirmed in UK court to seeing injuries on Amber’s arms after the Australia trip, he told her to hide the injuries from paparazzi. Depp also confirmed he had destroyed a phone in Australia (a way to hurt a hand), King initially denied a phone was broken until he was informed Depp just admitted this in court…King then changed his story and agreed a phone was broken after all, confirming Amber’s story about Depp repeatedly smashing a phone into the wall (and possibly injuring his hand).

(He sold the brand in 2022 so technically he’s “retired”.) He’s dressed by Anthony Vaccarello from Saint Laurent. It’s been described as sort of a “passing of the torch”. Given that Tom has history at Saint Laurent in the late 90s, it’s a fun call back to his legacy in fashion. Which is in line with the theme of the exhibit “Reawakening Fashion”, in the sense of reinvigorating historical fashion. The jacket is [Le Smoking](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Smoking), a line from SL in 1996. (Though some may argue 90s fashion isn’t historical, it sadly is considered vintage at this point). \n\nSo he is playing into the exhibit theme of historical fashion, and as far as dress code I would say it’s as simple as the flower boutonnière being on theme with the garden aspect, along with the color of the jacket being a deep red rose color. But I agree he’s definitely playing more into the theme than the dress code.",

More info from the press release about it -\n\n\nThe extravagant looks interpret ‘The Garden of Time’ through the lens of Swarovski, showcasing boundless creative possibilities,” Engelbert said. “They also celebrate the essence of the garden by transforming its elements — flowers, leaves, sunlight, air and water — into couture creations that capture nature’s beauty and joyful spirit.”\n\nThe models’ looks are meant to reflect these natural elements, with Kloss embodying a flower, Yai embodying water, Hammam embodying the sun and Engelbert embodying nature.\n\n“Each bespoke creation was envisioned to harmonize — and almost blend — seamlessly with the female body, enhancing and celebrating its form and essence,” Engelbert continued. “And each of the looks is a tribute to the inherent beauty of the women who inspired them and a celebration of the individuality of each muse.”",

Saying that her dad is the reason she has many friends is hilarious as if Rihanna gives a fuck about a british dude who works in real state or her great grandfather \n\nCara has several famous friends like Stella Mccartney (Who is also close to Taylor), Margot, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Suki Waterhouse etc\n\nOf course she owes her career to her family influence but her friends are just a consequence to her kind of career.",

She leads a truly WILD existence.\n\nI don't dislike her or begrudge her her life, quite the opposite. I'm fucking fascinated.

        "body": "Very astute of you, we're same gen for sure.. I remember allll of that. The magazines, how they treated Hillary Duff, how they treated Britney Spears when she performed Gimme More at the VMAs. I'm so sorry to hear about your suffering, especially since back then most people's response to eating disorders was \"JuSt EaT a SaNdWhIcH!!1!\" But you had to be so strong to overcome that, and I wish those same people understood what that takes. The fact diet culture's messaging was so strong they actually screened all media during treatment is mind blowing... I always thought I was fat from that messaging too, at 5'5\"-6\" and 135 lbs... (and the fact that my high school boyfriend bought into it wholesale and regurgitated it back to me didn't help), but my ED didn't surface until right after high school. My mom got me a trainer at LA Fitness thinking it'd help me feel better, but instead it turned into me purging by over-exercising and restricting my calories to only \"1200\" a day (though I always over-estimated so it was likely even less), I refused to ever sit, I'd park in the back of a parking lot and RUN to the store when I went shopping, I ate the same strictly regimented things at the same time every day until you could literally see every bone in my body, even my sternum without breathing in, and my period completely went away. It was at this point I started running into this creepy guy in a local bookstore (I'd go and read baking recipes which I'd then make for others and eat none of myself), and one of the times he approached me he complimented my body and asked how I stay in \"such great shape.\" Even then I was appalled. But I didn't get better until the nutritionist I was VERY lucky to have, told me that if I didn't stop what I was doing, my heart was either going to stop, or explode. And recovery was still a long, painful road.\n\nIt's a great insight that skincare is the new gen's version of weight loss for us, and while I don't have kids either, I find it kind of bittersweet... I'm glad that the new fixation is less of an immediate health risk, but also sad that it's just a different iteration of the same thing all over again - an obsession with the only two things we're told by mass media make us \"worthy\", youth and beauty. This is even highlighted by the \"clean girl\" trend, it's right out in the open that you're expected to look \"naturally beautiful\" and showing that it's still a trick but even then it's still the unobtainable dream that girls actively pursue... I suspect it's the same struggle our parents had, because no matter how many times you're told that media is an illusion, the messaging burrows deeper than that. It sucks, to say the least. But we came out of it, with scars but we did it... so these girls will be okay too, and they're at least more media savvy than we were, so hopefully the cuts aren't as deep and the trend keeps going until we're just clear of shit like this altogether.\n\nIf you happen to still be here after that novel, though... I'm glad you made it through and that you made it out on top. 11-20 is a long time, and I know that battle wasn't easy. I can't imagine what it really took. But I know it means you're awesome, and I'm happy you're here.",

This includes content they’re not even involved in. He gave the example, if bad bunny shows up in a cool outfit, he cannot repost a pic of bad bunny at the met on his social media. \n\nThe email says this is due to “several mishaps happening during and after the met gala” last year. \n\nSo yeah that rule is pretty ridiculous. But people on the comments are wondering if he was fired for maybe refusing to sign that NDA. Because yeah it’s stupid but it’s not like the worst thing ever, it’s not like harmful, just more of an annoyance.",

Is there a party that they all go to inside where the sit sipping drinks and telling other pretty people how pretty they are? or after the red carpet do they just do a u turn in the ally way and go back to their mansions after stops at every fast-food joint to eat after fasting for two weeks?

The time suck and cost of going through a lawsuit (even if it plays out in arbitration) isn’t negligible, and it’s why a lot of people ultimately follow the NDAs they’ve signed. \n\nAlso like I said, not *all* NDAs are unenforceable- in fact they regularly hold up. If this one actually says what he claims it does, it’s bizarre (how does reposting count as a “disclosure”..?) and yes likely not enforceable because it’s overbroad and not actually protecting sensitive information. Big emphasis on IF it says what he claims it does tho lol, this guy doesn’t sound like he’s got a firm grasp on the terms of the NDA. \n\nOther types of NDAs are *absolutely* enforceable though. If you sign an NDA when you become employed at a company before that company allows you access to sensitive data and information (like product development, business strategies, trade secrets, marketing strategies— tons of things), the duty not to publicly disclose that information will *totally* hold up in court. Even NDAs about the production behind reality shows regularly hold up in arbitrations. \n\nI think that people may be conflating NDAs with non-competes. Non-competes are actually tougher to enforce than NDAs, because they directly limit a person from future employment/earning a livelihood. But NDAs are not as frowned upon and not as difficult to draft in a way that’s enforceable.",

They were few and far between at events, usually brought as a date by a hot wall street schmuck, but never got down. Super awkward to be at a sex party with 10 guys salivating over and trying to cajole a girl who 100% has no intention of getting naked.

NDAs protecting sensitive information and trade secrets are regularly enforced by courts. I was explaining the policy reasons behind why *non-competes* have *always been* disfavored by courts (and unenforceable in some jurisdictions, including CA) long before the FTC finalized its new rule. Non-competes have basically never had teeth, even before the FTC’s new rule. Those same policy reasons *don’t* apply to NDAs, and it’s unclear why people in this thread believe NDAs to be unenforceable, which is why I suggested there may be some confusion between them and non-competes.",

        "body": "Non-competes have always been disfavored though for reasons that do not apply to NDAs. Non-competes actually purport to interfere with and limit how a person can earn a future livelihood. Public policy generally frowns upon limitations on a person’s freedom to work and earn money. Telling someone they can’t ever work at a competitor in their field after they’ve worked for you would be a *huge* hindrance to someone’s ability to earn a living. Even restricting someone from taking such a job for a few months is a ridiculous infringement on them. So that’s why non-competes are disfavored. \n\nThat really doesn’t apply to NDAs. There IS a strong public policy reason to prevent employees from disclosing a company’s trade secrets and sensitive information after their employment ends. And companies wouldn’t enter into transactions with each other that require the sharing of sensitive information if the other company could just turn around and publicize it. It would be really difficult for businesses to function competitively if former employees could disclose sensitive information once they leave. And there’s no real persuasive countervailing reason to *allow* a former employee to do that— it’s not predatory or limiting for a former employee to keep the sensitive info of a former employer secret. So NDAs have a really valid purpose behind them. \n\nWhat we see a lot on this sub are NDAs that celebrities seem to make everyone in their lives sign. That enters a more grey area for a lot of reasons— maybe there’s an absence of a business relationship that was mutually beneficial (eg they made some rando entering their house sign one but didn’t ever employ that person or confer to them any benefit), was the information that can’t be shared actually sensitive info, is the NDA totally overbroad. Those NDAs can become bogus real quick. But most NDAs are not like that, they’re standard practice in any business and I don’t think they’ll go anywhere.",

A story which would be far more widespread and vilifying. I'm not defending Jay-Z cheating, that shit is never right. But to cheer on literal assault because it's a woman attacking a man, it's hypocrisy. You cry for equality, scream bloody murder when a woman gets beaten by a man, but then cheer on happily when a woman attacks a man. What do you want, equality, or superiority? \n\nNo one is right in that situation. Well, the bodyguard for holding her back, he's good people.",

I've heard rumours from a few different sources that she's basically a shell, and that's why she barely reacts in the video. There's also the video of her at that basketball ball game staring straight ahead and swaying back and forth for an uncomfortably long time. I heard another story about her at, I believe, one of Diddy's white parties, where she apparently got into the pool (maybe even fully clothed) and just stood there for hours, causing Solange to freak out and eventually get removed from the party. \n\nBut of course, that's all rumours. But there are people who swear that's the case. Whatever it was, I'm hesitant to go with the narrative that Jay Z and Beyonce themselves put out. Their PR is top notch and they're notoriously quiet about their personal life. I don't see why they'd feel the need to tell us the truth. They could've easily said nothing at all, but I think Jay Z saw the controversy as a way to sell more records, so he gave it his own spin. Almost everyone can relate to a story about cheating, either as the cheater or the cheatee, and they got to sell both sides.",

    "selftext": "I posted the following as a comment a few months ago and people found it helpful. I thought reposting today might be useful before the Met Gala red carpet coverage tonight:\n\nThere are a lot of misconceptions about the Met Gala that drive me nuts.\n\nFirstly, it’s a charity event to raise money for the Met’s Costume Institute, not a random fancy-dress ball.\n\nSecondly, the “theme” is the subject of that year’s special exhibition. Calls to “just change the theme” a few weeks before the event because it’s controversial, like “Karl Lagerfield: A Line of Beauty,” are silly because museum exhibits are planned well in advance. There would be no feasible way to just have a different exhibition at the last minute.\n\nThirdly, speaking of themes, there is no requirement for attendees to dress to match the subject of the exhibition (EDIT: dress code this year is “garden of time.” Sometimes it’s more general like “white tie.”). Many do, because it’s fun and good press, but the constant “it’s great but they don’t match the theme ☹️” discourse after every Met Gala is eyeroll-worthy.\n\nLastly, most celebrities who attend the Met Gala are guests of the invited designers/fashion houses (some do buy their own ticket but they’re a minority). Therefore, if Margot Robbie is a guest of Chanel, then she has to wear Chanel. This also impacts the “following the theme” aspect - e.g. the celebrity guests for Moschino looked great at the “Camp: Notes on Fashion” gala but, unsurprisingly, looked less great at the “China: Through the Looking Glass” gala. And no one really, except Rihanna, went for the Rei Kawakubo/Commes des Garçons theme.\n\nSo, I love fashion, and love how much discussion the Met Gala generates. It’s like the red carpet Olympics, but the overexposure plus lack of understanding of why people might be wearing what they’re wearing can be irritating.",

The successes were groundbreaking and the failures were at least interesting and generated discussion- did it fail because it didn’t adhere to the theme, did it fail because it was poorly designed, did it fail because it didn’t work with the model, etc.\n\nSince then that’s what people hope for for the Met gala and I’m not going to look down my nose at them for being disappointed when they tune in to find just another generic display of red carpet standbys.\n\nFashion changes. Trends change. What people hope for from the Met gala has changed and at this point the constant ‘you just don’t *get* the Met gala’ feels like tired contrarianism that purposefully overlooks the point.\n\nPurism leads to stagnation and there is nothing worse in fashion than stagnation.

There’s so much more to it, that’s the point of all this.\n\nI’m looking at all of you who complained about Kylie Jenner in 2022. The theme was In America. She’s wearing an American brand by an American designer. She’s mixing bridal with street fashion (both clearly American in style). She’s paying homage to headwear worn on the runway with this gown (it was a horse jockey helmet), but switched it up to be a baseball hat (does it get more American than baseball?) She’s playing with multiple literal and metaphorical ties to the theme AND dress code. I don’t love her but if one more person puts this look on “worst dressed list” I’m gonna combust.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3droiwbctwyc1.jpeg?width=2216&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2bfd35a0b956396aba871fd6d333f6b984e6b7d9",

It may not be a requirement but it's highly encouraged. The people who don't follow the theme make me side eye, its the \"rules for thee not for me\" vibe. If every designer chose to ignore the theme it would just be a standard red carpet and lose what makes it so special.

I agree with you that it’s become expected that lots of attendees will try to match the theme and, in general, people pay attention to the Met Gala because of the often extraordinary or avant-garde fashion.  My point is that doing so is not required and, more importantly, most attendees are invited by fashion houses and can be limited in their choices of what to wear. I’m not saying that we should avoid celebrating the great looks, but, maybe we should give attendees some grace if they’re invited by a designer or fashion label whose comfort zone is well away from the theme.  \n\n I’d also argue that most people don’t know the history of the Met Gala or how it changed throughout the 2000s (and I’d argue that it started changing around Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty). There’s a difference between advocating for pushing the envelope in fashion because the Met Gala has become a great venue for that, versus being salty that whatever celebrity in question didn’t or wasn’t able to have a good enough “costume.” ",

I thought it was a super clever, thoughtful take on the theme. \n\nBut re: your point about literal theme.. I honestly think Andrew Mukmal and Margot Robbie created a monster lol. The literal interpretations worked bc Barbie was a fashion doll. Anything else looks cheesy and try hard. Intent is what separates a great look from a “that’s nice but whatever” look. What’s the intent behind a dress covered in tennis rackets for a movie about tennis? In their defense, other than actual tennis-style looks and references to specific players, there’s not much to work with. But bc people expect this literal thematic dressing, it’s boxed them in. The Dune tour was so incredible bc it’s more abstract and conceptual.* \n\n*I always have to mention this bc #nerdrage but the Mugler robot was so painfully not on theme yet everyone lost their mind for it.

There is a lot of shade thrown at historical costuming as an area of study that stems from pure misogyny. People tend to trivialize the wearable arts and think of them as frivolous - when in reality it is every bit as much a valid form of expression and a crucial way of learning about our past. This year’s theme really highlights the importance of conservation, and the work that goes into textile preservation. We learn a lot from what people wore through the years, and those garments degrade over time when exposed to air, light, and body oils. Their work is preserving some of the most delicate historical objects in existence, and yet they get no funding for their efforts largely because it has historically been the realm of women and queer men. Thanks to this event, that work can continue and we can preserve an important part of history.",

The Met Gala didn't focused as much on celebrity culture in the early years, it was simply an upscale fundraiser for high society. \n\nThe first themed year was 1973 and it was \"The World of Balenciaga\". The structure of a theme has been continued since then. The theme is what started to set it apart from other fundraisers and galas, they also had started to invite more celebrities and models to attend which elevated it's status while gaining additional exposure.

That's how benefits and fundraisers work. So if an attendee buy a $250,000 ticket and the dinner is $200, they can claim the $250, 800 as a charitable donation on their taxes.\n\nThat is literally what  what a tax writeoff is. A tax writeoff is an expense you can claim as a deduction. The attendees expend the cost of the ticket and then claim it as a deduction.\n\nIt's the same with charity auctions. If you bid $4000 for a spa day at an auction, and it would normally cost $500, it's $3,500 of your income that you don't have to pay taxes on. If you join your local public radio station for $60 and they send you a $10 tote bag, you can claim a $50 donation.",

Clients of ours are wine makers, they would donate wine and deduct associated expenses related. Do I need to continue, or are we good? :)\n\nPerhaps the Met Gala does not include an auction or donated items for the attendees that those vendors could deduct?

        "body": "So the sleeping beauties theme refers to items of clothing that were worn once and never again, mostly because they’re too fragile to put back on. This was the theme for the gala’s exhibit which put out various archival pieces like this on display. Vogue had a great description of it - “embodying the beauty of the natural world, its fragility, and its inevitable decay.”\n\nTyla’s dress fits the theme because she’s the only one to have worn it, and as Olivier cuts it, the gown disappears and can’t be re-worn. It’s a dress that was designed with the knowledge that it would inevitably be destroyed. The exhibit is also broken into subthemes of Land, Sea and Sky and I think the use of sand does a good job of invoking this nature/elemental aspect.\n\nThe dress code was The Garden of Time, which is based on a short story of the same name and goes hand in hand with the idea of inevitable decay. In the story the characters are rich and living in a luxurious villa, and they must pluck flowers from their garden to reverse time and stave off an angry mob that comes nearer every hour. Eventually they run out of flowers and the villa is overtaken, becoming destroyed by the mob.\n\nTyla’s outfit is meant to invoke this theme of time passing. It’s inspired by the phrase “the sands of time,” which is a saying used to describe the passage of time. She carried an hourglass with her on the carpet to tie in this concept of sand with time trickling by.\n\nIt’s a thought provoking but difficult theme to dress for! I love that her take is both unique and shows a real understanding of the event’s concept.",

They attend awards shows and premieres for their work or to support their friends and colleagues but rarely do they show up for the sake of attention.\n\nThat is what the MET gala has been the last few years as social media has been on the rise - A place to get attention which is why you are seeing fewer A-list people attend and more influencers and reality TV people.\n\nThis is also not a knock on the actors who do show up. Some of them are really into fashion and it's a thing for them, but I do think they do enjoy the attention fashion brings them.",

Why are you trying to imply that he was trying to sleep with an 11 year old boy( thats right, it was a boy so wrong again) when the kid wasn't even there? He also \\*literally\\* did not go to jail for this. He went to jail for possession of cocaine,heroin,and crack. The family that owned the house did not view the incident as malicious and actually spoke out for him after he was arrested for tresspassing.",

Both homes are on the west side of the road and have similar-looking double wooden garage entrances.\n\n____\n\nCurtis’ wife noticed Downey sleeping when she entered the room, sometime around 9 p.m., thinking one of her children was playing a game. She called sheriff’s deputies and a neighbor, who found Downey’s identification. Paramedics revived the actor.\n\n“He was sitting up--groggy, looking very white and gaunt,” Curtis said. “At no time was he doing anything the least bit threatening.”",

We are vaccinated for COVID for a reason and it's a non issue for 99%+ of the population. \n\nPeople have the right to take the safety precautions that are the best for them and their health, but frankly it's not reasonable to expect the vast majority of people to continue to social distance or wear masks for COVID anymore. If you are advocating for wearing masks and social distancing every time you get sick (with COVID, influenza, sinus infections) that is your right, but you're in the vast minority and you can't be upset when other people don't want to live their lives that way",

But now she lives in a multi-million-dollar home in Beverly Hills and Louis Vuitton dresses her for Paris Fashion Week. How do her fans reconcile the elitist, Condé Nast darling she is now with the unprepossessing girl they used to love?\n\nOr maybe people like to see American Dream in action. It's inspiring. And don't get me wrong, I respect the hustle ... I just don't understand how she did it. She's a pretty, young, middle-class white woman so maybe she was destined to succeed. Or maybe the dumb blonde schtick is an act. Or maybe she just has a good business manager.\n\nSomeone please explain it to me. ",

YouTubers were big when she started, so it was easy for her to gain ground. Nowadays, TikTok is king and it would have been harder for her to get fans. She also added sound effects and editing stuff to her videos which weren’t really all that popular at the time. It was innovative and entertaining for her viewers. (In a similar vein, Charlie D’Amelio skyrocketed her fame because she started at the very beginning of TikTok and knew how to use trends to get her viewers.)\n\nShe also capitalized quickly on her success. She got brand deals and started her own company. She knew to change her fame into dollar signs which not a lot of famous influencers succeed at. \n\nAnd she’s kept her nose clean. Influencers like Shane Dawson and David Dobrik burned themselves by getting involved in major scandals. That killed their success pretty quickly. They have money still, but they don’t make content anymore and usually their names are tied to a major scandal. Emma hasn’t had major issues.

And she always had some level of privacy/distance with her fans. No mess that I can recall. She also used to be in a clique of very famous influencers that a lot of teens watched (the Dolan twins and I think James Charles pre scandal).\n\nA lot of people have talked about, and I think she herself is kind of grappling, with the situation now that she's not relatable anymore. I've heard some saying she lacks perspective and should have gone to college or done more 'regular people' things to gain some experience, but at the same time a lot of people find her comforting or entertaining. I think she's also reflecting on the situation a lot and doesn't come across as trying too hard to either remain relatable or flaunt her wealth, she comes across as pretty authentic (which I realize isn't necessarily actual authenticity).\n\nTo me she came across as very smart, creative and driven. A lot of people copied her editing style at the time. I also felt that she had a solid support system with her parents, but I don't know enough about her to be sure on that-it just feels like she's been able to stay pretty down to earth. I didn't perceive her as trying to milk as much as possible from her fame, rather like she was strategic and picky about what she did, and took some risks.\n\nI don't keep up with her a lot but she's one of the only influencers whose transition into the established 'offline' entertainment industry has felt pretty natural, to me. I think that's both down to her personality/talent for what she does now, and her management/how she's perceived by brands or how she's managed. As someone else said, her being thin and white but not having the classic influencer look plus her established interest in fashion puts her in a good position to work with more high fashion brands. She doesn't have Instagram Face, doesn't flaunt logos or post amazon fashion hauls to my recollection, and already positioned herself as a fashion girlie, and imo she comes across as someone who doesn't cling to influencer numbers as much as others and is ready to sacrifice some of her following for her career. That might make her more attractive to luxury brands. In that way she's similar to bestdressed aka Ashley.",

They all watched her videos too and I think that helps her likability on the red carpet because people are more honest with her. \n\nI gotta be honest, I do not like her interviewing skills at all, because while she's chatty and has great energy and gets people to talk to her, she's really up their ass. She loves everything and everyone. This is part of her charm though; I'm just a bit of a cynic. \n\nWhile she is a pretty white woman from middle class, she's very unusual looking, and in her blog she's not made up ever, she's without make up and being a regular human at home, so that is also relatable. The whole production of her blog is in line with the tastes of the time, the music and edit and vibe are very pleasing.\n\nAnd last, I think people do like to see the American Dreams..to a point. Then we must tear them down. So let's see when that happens. I think if she makes one wrong comment or hangs out with the wrong person, the fans will turn as they often do.",

She removed herself with most of the beauty community and curated her outputs to be less about output, more about quality.  I think she also smartly shifted away from her weekly quirky vlogs with cheeky rants and evolved with her audience who are now mostly collegiate students who are reflecting with their impending move to adulthood. Her vlogs nowadays are almost existential meandering (of her past) whilst doing tourist stuff. \n\nShe clearly still is on a pedestal in terms of her position. She could very well be thrown in the curb BUT I think she is respected by a lot of fashion brand since there is an actual interest with fashion AND she has a sense of understanding of the hifalutin nature of the industry. She can quirky and relatable BUT she knows that there is a fine line she could quirk it up before the industry's high status be considered as cheap. Thus, they still come back to her.",

Then covid happened and she suddenly became internet ITGIRL because of her vlogs. And then podcast and coffee. And fashion girls liked her she was one of ITGIRLs promoting crochet fashion and had cool and achievable style and suddenly she was on fashion week getting all of this promo. Vogue somehow liked her and this mag is known for not really promoting influencers because they see them as competitors. They are really picky with internet people that’s why when they are choosing someone they are staying for longer. Also her met gala interviews were doing good on tiktok in past years so she got a spot again.\n\nIt was similar with Tavi Gevinson back in late 2000’s early 2010’s. Vogue liked her so they were promoting her. \n\nI prefer influencers who had some bottom starting point so Emma can stay for me over some tiktok overnight successes.",

I think Emma was always most passionate about social media and based on where she is now she did a good job with it. \n\nI’ve always been more of a casual observer of hers since she started making videos. She was never my taste (and I was a bit out of her intended audience age range in my opinion) but her editing was always good and consistently got chuckles out of me.

Emma herself still has that personality that got her the YouTube fame. Still quirky, honest, funny, blunt. Relatable. Her flying around and get into shows isn’t what’s relatable of course but that goes for every actor / actress / singer we fawn over. Love her podcast and how she keeps it real. Always been so grateful for her success. She has charisma. And people say “basic” but I’m like… isn’t that being a normal human? LOL.

We all are growing humans lol. but anyways back to her fans. I see her in comments all the time the amount of people saying they were OGs and the views itself show.

I'm sure Jared helped too but I went to read an interview with him after watching this video and he says the process is very collaborative and she has a very strong vision, opinions and sense of style already.

YouTube don’t pay as crazy as it used to and for people to literally make money they do need different platforms and also like sharing it to places where other people can garner their eyes to it. TikTok blew up for many reasons but why a lot of people o like it is because it’s short format and easier for them to keep updated and tune into people’s lives. Not everyone has the attention span or time to watch long winded YouTube videos which is why YouTube was a niche for awhile and honestly still is because not everyone can do what those youtibers can do and also watch it for that long. That’s why I think of people who love Money McMichael. She blew up tiktok but was making YouTube a little before that and doesn’t get as crazy views as TikTok bc sooo many people now prefer the short format. Instagram has always been around lol. Emma also had deleted TikTok for awhile for her mental health too?? So. Idk, maybe I just find it always weird for people to do that. You can tell when things are a cash grab when they’re not well thought or authentic but considering her YouTube videos are as long as they could be, her tiktoks are silly BTS, Instagram is already what she’s putting out, and podcasts are her life as well as YouTube.. it makes sense. But I also like the business side of how all this works and I just don’t think people look at the full picture because of some things.. and you did say it was kinda fake before so I think I was in well meaning in saying the ingenuine part 😂",

Ataumbi echoes the sentiment—and wanted to ensure the final design reflected this as well. “I’m so proud of Lily—she is breaking so many barriers,” says Ataumbi. “I didn’t want to bring a Native costume to the Met Gala, because we’ve been fighting against that for so long.\"\n\nOnce I read that part, I understood their motivations. The dress might be one of those that doesn't come across as well in pictures/on camera though. Which is too bad because the backstory is so lovely and meaningful.

It’s one of my favorite days of the year.  \n\n\nI can’t wait to sit and judge all the looks, as I sit and stew in my developing spray tan, looking like a pale little piggy who has just rolled through mud, in a pretty flowered granny gown that was $11 at the local Walmart. I don’t have any sense of fashion, but that does not stop me from super judgmental tonight 😂\n\nMe and the teen make a night of it every year. We have our dry erase boards that will rate each look on and then hold up to show each other and compare. The preteen has decided to join this year. Dinner is ready and we will plop down in front of the tv. One of my favorite nights of the year.",

You didn’t have to look like the 18th century, you didn’t have to dress like a hamburger, you didn’t have to arrive in a van where you were standing up because you couldn’t sit down because you wore a chandelier.”\n\nI disagree tho because it’s undeniable that the theme and the guests’ costumey adherence to it has made the gala bigger than it used to be which means more money for museum.",

There’re very few high profile places where these artisans get to display their craft and be the center of attention. They could easily book themselves for a whole year or longer when featured.

Wow, the Driz scumbags have been working hard to suppress the story despite a TMZ photographer being beaten at the time also. \n\nThe beatings were absolutely diabolical. The verdict has been published online however. Even their legal counsel withdrew after the discovery phase was completed. \n\nTwins Alberto and Mauritz Driz were leaving their 60th birthday party with Mauritz’s son Shawn and his mate William Joelson. All 4 started abusing the valet leading to a TMZ photographer (I can’t seem to find their name) trying to intervene leading to all 4 beating into him. The brutality of the attack lead to Anne and Matthew Greene trying to help the photographer. All three were beaten to unconsciousness by these animals. Anne had a fractured skull and broken vertebrae, Matthew had surgery to remove a portion of intestine resulting from the attacks. \n\nImagine what else they’ve gotten away with over the years.\n\nhttps://juryverdictalert.com/assault-and-battery/assault-4-defendants-2-plaintiffs",

The Arnold Classic is in the city where I grew up and there were TONS of stories about the gross shit Arnold did and said to women. Groping, staring, comments. The whole 9 yards. I feel really weird that he’s become this wholesome figure. I felt the same way about Kobe Bryant. Like maybe he has grown up but he’s still a rapist whose legal team’s brutal tactics ruined a woman’s life for daring to be his victim.",

I used to work in nonprofit fundraising in NYC and the amount we spent on the annual galas was kind of ridiculous  but it was expected that the rich people we invited would donate much more than the cost. Like the “honoree” would give a million, one table could cost 250k, etc. Not to mention the sponsors.\n\nSurprisingly the MET has never made the bulk of its money from ticket sales, it’s mostly wealthy benefactors. I know the MET gala has always been a little different from other nonprofit galas but I’m sure whoever is keeping track of the money is making sure they don’t spend more than they bring in.",

I feel that the turning point was Notes on Camp (2019) because all attendees were encouraged to go over the top and then designers never looked back. I think that was the year of the Katy Perry Chandelier and Hamburger. The event is getting much more coverage than it used to and generating a ton of conversations on social media… although I’m not sure if this translates into more funds raised. (Hopefully it does!) It’s certainly impressive to see all that creativity and skills on display for one night. I would say that the only downside is that there’s now so much going on all at once that some interesting looks fall under the radar because everyone is trying to pull the show stopper.",

She later filmed an \"apology\" saying something within the lines of \"i'm sorry that you felt this way\". I don't think she apologised to the gelateria owner, just the fans. People reacted positively to the frozen yoghurt shop and it became crowded, so demi's plan backfired because the shop had been this popular until she tried to shame them for being inclusive.",

Even when she does some thing like her big comeback from her overdose and when she was finally on a stage again at a big performance, she got attention, but then she didn’t do music for a bit and then when she did, it was nothing like what got her attention and people were liking and then the consistency isn’t there. I like her music, and I actually really liked the podcast that she did in a world of too many unnecessary podcasts, I thought hers was pretty good if a tinge of the weirdness that has gone into her other things like the sex toy and the aliens thing. And I am all for having fun and, sex related deals if you can get them. Christina Aguilera is doing lube ads, and also injectables ads and I’m a fan of both of them overall.\n\nI feel like this kind of ad is walking a really odd line because with a history of eating disorders and body dysmorphia, and the weight of that on your mental health, and also having been treated terribly by her former team, like that song, Watermelon Cake, it’s just an odd thing to try and be advertising and selling to others. Because you’re basically hawking something that is aiming at people’s insecurities.",

Well, if I ate.” The episode was pulled for a while after Demi tweeted about it, and was later re-aired with that part edited out.  \nAll this was happening pretty early on in Demi’s recovery from her own eating disorder, and she was still pretty young at the time (18/19). Party It Up originally aired like a month or two after Demi left Disney to go to rehab, and the tweets were from about a year after the episode’s original air date. It’s mentioned [further down in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/popculturechat/s/iYbqPxgIQi) that Demi didn’t go after or name Zendaya specifically in her tweets.",

Timberline Knolls got busted several years back bc one of their male therapists was caught SAing the young girls he treated. No other SA news has ever made me so angry. His victims were so very vulnerable.

Compared to other exhibitions, Sleeping Beauties was already a broad theme and paring that with a dress code of “Garden of Time” in reference to a metaphorical essay didn’t help.   \n\nCompare it to previous met gala theme/dress code pairs and you’ll see the issue. Last year was Lagerfeld’s exhibition and the dress code was “honor Karl.” Before that was the Americana exhibition and the dress code was “gilded glamour, white tie.” The dress code usually provides useful context to the theme but this year’s didn’t. \n\nI think it becomes a problem considering many people judge the celebrities outfits by how on theme they are (which I don’t agree with). If that wasn’t such popular sentiment, I don’t think a “confusing” or nebulous theme would matter.",

        "body": "It wasn't that difficult of a theme and dress code, all you had to do was read the very short story or even a synopsis to make the connection. It was open to interpretation (as the better ones are imo) and let one play with the fragility and ephemeral nature of beauty,  what is progress vs regress, preservation vs degradation, nature vs civilization, the ravages of time, et c. A lot of these exact themes are often metaphorically expressed through gardens. So garden motifs or real florals can share this without trying because its something they already represent, especially the idea that beauty is fleeting. Anything with a butterfly theme also represents it as butterflies are becoming less and less common in our landscape but they also get pinned up as delicate decoration even when they are dead. \n\nI think there were a good percentage of people reasonably on theme /dress code. Some played to the theme by wearing things that looked fragile and/or would not be wearable the same way a second time. Others repurposed old materials that were destroyed in order to create something new or wore echos of pieces lost to time. Others wore things showing (manufactured) signs of wear. I also think a lot of people went the ozymandius route and showed up as some nod to classical statuary too (maybe why all the nude and beige, along with sand references). I would say all those people did follow the dress code and theme in one way or another. And even just the florals and garden party ideas did fit (something from a bygone era) just less interesting. \n\nStill, I did expect a bit more vintage. Letting those things whose time has passed be seen again is like a recipe for spaced repetition. It preserves the memory of fashion in the mind of civilisation even while risking material culture. Especially thought there would be more vintage Mcqueen or nods to him because this kind of gothic/romantic preoccupation was a big part of his work. Alas only a few glimpses of the lost genius. And maybe it's just as well.",

Turns out it was supposed to be fabrics and designs meant to only be worn once because they are so fragile or intricate they'd need to be preserved at the Met after being worn just the once (therefore considered sleeping beauties), and with that, capture the elements of earth, water, and sky. It's also based on a JG Ballard tale where the nature around the characters is so fragile, mostly barren, and impossible to preserve/sustain that it's akin to trying to hold onto sand in your palm: grains will continue to fall out until there's nothing left. Each day, the main character picks a magical crystal flower (the only flowers left in this universe) in his garden to keep an army from approaching and overtaking his villa until there are no flowers left, leaving his garden as barren as the surrounding landscape. It symbolizes a repetitive cycle of mankind's destruction of the natural world/a lack of respect for nature in order to preserve mankind's own interests and desires.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I actually think that's a great theme, but on its face it's very confusing.",

During the presentation, the mannequins were on platforms that would lower beneath the stage so they could be swapped out for the next set of mannequins. Basically, asking about whether or not certain clothing should even be worn by people at all or if it’s only for display.",

They're basically exactly in line with what your image is saying, the last sentence specifically. \n\n\nThat being said, imo there's quite a difference between fashion as an art form and most of the other arts. If a musician writes a bad song and decides to throw it away or an artist starts a painting over because of an error, the amount of time, energy, and resources wasted is far less then when a team of designers, crafters, etc. put together a full work of art just so that one person can decide whether or not it will be worn at all and then discard it after a single use. \n\n\nHowever, there are far greater problems with the fashion industry than the issue of the money and time spent on art for an event like this. Maybe these issues stem from wealthy people doing stuff like this, but it seems more likely that the issues are not a result of the excess at the top, since as you say, a big part of art is in the excesses. ",

The blonde softens her features and this makes her skin look kind of ruddy and harsh. This one is an overall miss for me personally.\n\nEdit:  And also adding I agree with others that she just looks like Billie here.  It worsens the look for me because it feels like a stolen style, even though Billie doesn't own black hair and ballgowns with gloves as a style. It's just too similar.",

I pretty much despise Elon Musk but I'll still call people out for mocking his autistic traits.\n\nETA: Many of the experts don't know what they're doing when they assess women for autism because the assessment was designed around the presentation of autism in little boys. My assessment and diagnosis was not that far off from an \"armchair diagnosis\" because the psychiatrist, with all of her thirty years experience assessing boys, said that she knew about as much about the female presentation of autism as I did, and asked for the list of books I'd read. So that accusation isn't the gotcha you think it is. \n\nAlso, the harm in armchair diagnoses is when someone oversteps their authority by giving advice to the person. I haven't suggested Jojo do anything. I've suggested that the public shouldn't be dicks to her. Is that really overstepping?",

Released multiple songs directly criticizing the government and Korean society (No More Dream, Bapsae, N.O., Dope, Spine Breaker, Am I Wrong, Spring Day, etc.)\n2. Said that they're going to \"become the Kim Jong-Un of the hip-hop world\" (If I Ruled the World)\n3.

Made entire songs based on their mental health conditions, something that's very taboo socially, including naming the specific conditions they have (depression, OCD, etc) and talking about their past history of suicidal ideation\n\nSure, the government will criticize artists and try to censor them, just like the American government does, but most artists will.... Very rarely follow that. Off the top of my head - yesterday, a kpop artist (Solar) released a new music video in which she dances with drag performers and flips off the camera; Kard has an entire song about anal (and a discography that's like, 90% sex songs); Mamamoo (specifically the member Solar), BlackPink, and Miss A have pole danced at awards shows; and multiple idols such as RM of BTS, Irene of Red Velvet, and Sooyoung of SNSD have publicized a feminist book which criticizes the gender gap in Korea and is *extremely* controversial among the Korean general public.\n\nIt doesn't matter where you are in the world, people are always going to use music as a way to criticize the world around them.",

    "selftext": "https://people.com/dogs-dress-in-canine-copies-of-2024-met-gala-looks-for-pet-gala-8651847\n\n\nExcerpt: For the inaugural Pet Gala, dogs arrived in custom couture created by Rubio. Over the past two weeks, Rubio crafted all the Pet Gala canine fashions to ensure that each outfit was a pet-friendly recreation of a look from the 2024 Met Gala.\n\n\n\"I want people to understand that we're not making fun of the Met Gala. We're not mimicking the Met Gala,\" Rubio told the Associated Press. \"We're elevating and appraising and appreciating the wonderful designs that were presented at the Met Gala by the most talented designers of the world.\"\n\n\n1. Designer Anthony Rubio designed a Pet Gala gown for his Chihuahua Kimba modeled after Zendaya's first 2024 Met Gala dress.\n\n\n2. Lala the Pomeranian arrived at the Pet Gala wearing a recreation of Nicki Minaj's look.\n\n\n3. Chorkie (Chihuahua/Yorkie) Miley-Jo opted for Cardi B's show-stopping black dress as inspiration for her Pet Gala look.\n\n\n4. Ted Gram the poodle arrived at Pet Gala in the canine version of Bad Bunny's Met Gala look.\n\n\n5. Ed Sheeran's baby blue Met Gala suit inspired Fritz the Pomeranian's Pet Gala outfit.\n\n\n6. A dog named Daffodil brought Jennifer Lopez's look to life on the Pet Gala carpet.\n\n\n7. Henry the Shih Tzu opted for an outfit that pulled from Cynthia Erivo's Met Gala fashion.\n\n\n8. A Morkie (Maltese/Yorkshire Terrier) named Livie was tapped to wear a recreation of Gigi Hadid's Met Gala look.\n\n\n9. Saya wore a riff on Shakira's Met Gala gown to the 2024 Pet Gala.\n\n\n10. Superman, a Leonberger, wore a look inspired by model Irina Shayk.\n\n\n11. Suki, a Chinese crested, dressed à la Gayle King.",

It was followed by a 90 minute shower where I tried to scrub as much of it off as I could—it’s a wonder I had any skin left! I remember it was so streaky, my ankles, knees, elbows, knuckles had all absorbed so much product and came out so much darker than everywhere else, and I just generally looked *filthy*.) \n\nBut there’s Elle being all pale and looking radiant and made of moonlight and it warms my heart. She also wears a lot of colors I would never dream of (cream?ivory?!?) but wears them so well.",

They are actively courting the publicity so it would not be considered copying or stealing or shady if the celebrity actually wore one of their gowns. That’s how designers like Donatella stay in the public eye. \n\nIn this case, JLo in that dress went on to be one of the most famous images of it’s time so Donatella was surely beyond thrilled. It was a huge win for everyone involved. A few years ago, Versace even had JLo walk their runway show modeling a reimagined version of the dress.",

Then the excitement of all night developing the photos seeing if you got the shot! And then to be one of the ones being photographed you gotta hit that pose!  It’s interesting to look at how red carpet posing has changed with the digital age. Notice how diff her pose is than others of course she’s a model she’s got advantage but it’s a good example of how simple things change so much you’re so drawn to her and it somehow feels so natural where others are more stiff and stand straight.",

No one suits the theme more than she does. \n\nI’m also gonna guess of the euphoria girlies that Hunter Schaefer will have my favorite look. \n\nI think Colman Domingo will serve if there, no man is doing it like him. He’s just got it. \n\nI could see Quinta Brunson having a great look if she’s with a designer that’s NOT Siriano. Even though Siriano’s camp look for Janelle Monae is one of my favorites ever, I don’t think he has the nuance for this theme and whatever he does is just gonna be a flower explosion. \n\nSpeaking of, Janelle Monae will probably also be on my best dressed list. She just always has a direction, her looks always make a statement. \n\nNicola Coughlan! Another interesting fashion girlie with potential! I think her team has really figured out dressing her body in beautiful and unique ways and I think if she’s there she could stun me. \n\nBella Hadid - has been absolutely radiant lately, makes me think she’s gonna absolutely slay today. \n\nWorst dressed guesses:\n\nSelena Gomez. I’m so sorry girl, I hope to god I’m wrong. But unlike Nicola Coughlan, I don’t think anyone knows what to do with Selena. I wish they did, because I think she’s gorgeous. \n\nHailey Bieber: If I had to guess, she will wear something extremely minimal and not very thematic, which I hate. I bet she will look good but be a total snooze, which is enough to get on my worst dressed list. \n\nIm gonna guess Glen Powell will be there wearing nothing but a simple black tux, snooze. \n\nI’m gonna guess Daisy Edgar Jones might also wear something very snoozey, even though she’s gorgeous it just won’t stun. \n\nAnd I think Billie Eilish might also be a candidate for this I’m sorry don’t hate me but even as a host and with all that press I thought she was worst dressed last year (edit: ugh 2022 time freaking flies. Where have the past four years gone). The color was sickly on her and it looked more cosplay than gown. I don’t think the theme today suits her style at all, and it’s hard for me to imagine for her. I hope I’m wrong though! There are many Billie looks I’ve loved in the past.",
