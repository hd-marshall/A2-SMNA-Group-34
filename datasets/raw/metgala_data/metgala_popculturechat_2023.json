It‚Äôs incredibly difficult to trick yourself into ‚Äújust arriving 10 minutes early‚Äù because you know that‚Äôs not the time it starts. You‚Äôd need someone else telling you that and not know what the starting time is and even then your brain still kicks in with ‚Äúgotta shower, do my hair and get dressed, yup twenty minutes should do it‚Äù. \n\nADHD is a disability and the brains of people who have it are legit different. If it were as easy as ‚Äúget a planner‚Äù or ‚Äújust set an alarm‚Äù, all things people with ADHD do btw trust me, then we‚Äôd be doing it and move on.

Like it's really simple, learn how long it take you get ready, and leave that amount of time. She would say she'd get distracted on her phone, then don't take your phone up to your room to get ready.\n\nAlso people who are chronically late always act like its never their fault and its not a big deal and/or shout at the people who ask them to make sure they're on time. It's so rude and it drives me insane\n\nAlso these people have clearly never worked a job like customer service for example or they'd have sorted it out by now otherwise they'd constantly be getting fired, there's such a privilege attached to it and it infuriates me",

        "body": "Of course! There are several things at play here, and I‚Äôll try to put them together in a coherent/helpful way. I feel a bit of backstory is necessary, as it severely influenced my decisions and current behaviours.\n\n1. I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 9/10 years old, I am now 34, so I have had 2.5 decades where I am aware of it. However, I didn‚Äôt tackle my MH & ADHD until my mid-20‚Äôs. Luckily, I moved to a country with free healthcare at 27 (I‚Äôm originally from the USA) and therapy and medications are covered under the NHS, so I am privileged in that way. As I know not everyone has access to those resources. \n\n2. I grew up in a very abusive household that demanded perfection (which, as a person with severe ADHD, was extremely difficult). I was never allowed to be late, or screw up, and so it kind of conditioned me, also I have anxiety/OCD which drives me to be on time. Additionally, my mom has narcissistic personality disorder, and I was always hyper aware of upsetting her- which translates into how I interact with everyone. I am very cautious with doing anything that could inconvenience another person. \n\n3. The biggest thing I learned in therapy and taught myself is understanding my ADHD, how it influences my actions and reactions, and learn to work WITH it instead of against it. Honestly, that was the biggest shift, I literally feel like I‚Äôve re-wired my brain to not take things at face value, process information in a way I can digest, and find tools that prevent me from getting over stimulated and absent minded (because overstimulation and absent mindedness go hand-in-hand for me).  For instance, I now keep a very tidy house where I know where things are at all times. It keeps me from wasting time constantly searching (or forgetting). If it‚Äôs something I need to remember everyday (such as taking meds) I leave them right next to an item I use every morning so they‚Äôre always staring me in the face. \n\n4. I also set alarms and reminders for EVERYTHING (and yes, half of the battle is reminding you to set reminders lol). Find the best way to remind yourself, if that‚Äôs a physical calendar, your phone, etc‚Ä¶eventually you will ‚Äútrick‚Äù your neurodivergent brain into muscle memory.\n\nI hope this helps and makes sense! I tried to be specific while also sharing my experience and motivations.",

The Axis P3225 camera has a microphone attachment that slips in the camera cover with one small hole that the mic is pushed up against to capture sound. I  can hear the person speaking on the other line if someone is having a phone conversation down a hallway. Way further than you'd guess it could. Of course, if there are multiple conversations you will have the traditional issue of separating them but the sound quality wouldn't be the biggest issue. Also depending on the software running the camera I am sure it's possible to do. \n\nBonus side tid bit: In my state it is illegal to have a camera installed that you know doesn't work. Same with dummy cameras, can't do it. If someone can prove you knew it didn't work but kept it up you could face huge fines.",

Third is that the chest/breast area just sort of seems to hang there, which I think is more a result of the scarf. I think if she'd gotten rid of the scarf and added a burst of color via a necklace or something like that it would have been a bit better.   \n\n\nAlso, a bit surprised that Janeane Garofalo didn't land on the list. Around the late 90s she was invited to the Oscars. She'd always been around, but she had begun making a lot of popular, mainstream romantic comedies. However Garofalo was also someone who liked taking a stand against the norm and beauty standards... so she went to this major awards show wearing a schlubby sweater and jeans. I think that she may have also been doing it because she kept getting flack for her formal outfits in general. I remember Joan Rivers going having a fit because of this outfit and made her the worst dressed person of the event.",

Not just because of the time period but also because it was worn at the Oscars and by an A-list celebrity. You might expect to see some daring outfits elsewhere, but you just didn't wear something like this at the Oscars. I mean, look at the reception to what Jennifer Lopez wore to the 2000 Grammy Awards. She was known for making bold statements and people expect more daring outfits at the Grammys. Yet there were *still* people who thought it was too much.  \n\nThen you have Paltrow. People just expected A-listers to come wearing your typical Oscar clothing. This was an especially big change for Paltrow, as people expected her to wear something like the pink dress she wore in 2000. This was a huge, HUGE change in her personal tastes as she was often photographed wearing \"girlier\" things like [this](https://www.gettyimages.ie/detail/news-photo/actress-gwyneth-paltrow-arrives-at-the-55th-annual-tony-news-photo/1318168?adppopup=true). \n\nLooking back, it's honestly pretty tame by today's standards. I still don't think the top did her any favors, but it's not because of anything with her body. I just think that the way the tulle (or whatever it is) folds over just looks odd over pale skin/fabric. If she'd had a darker tulle under that to soften the way the folds it wouldn't stand out as much. But then that'd make it a completely different outfit and she was definitely trying to make a statement.",

This rumor comes up all the time but I have no idea how it started - maybe the gossip magazines wondered why Josh Charles wasn't her date at the Oscars and when her publicist finally admitted the relationship was over, they cooked up this story. But the fact is, Josh didn't attend any of the earlier 2002 awards shows with Jennifer, either. She went stag to the BAFTAs (Feb) and the Golden Globes (Jan). She also went solo to all the premieres of ABM through Dec 2001. \n\nPaul Bettany had said in an interview many years ago that he first got together with Jennifer when they ran into each other at the BAFTAs and by that time they were both single. In a separate interview, Jennifer - who is super private - would only confirm that their romance first blossomed in London. Which isn't a confirmation of the timeline, but it fits. Also, Paul attended the 2002 Oscars despite not being nominated for anything, and although he wasn't officially Jennifer's date, he did wear a champagne tie that *just happened* to match her dress. [Here's a picture, which kinda tells its own story separate from the color-coordination.](https://imgur.com/tw8aCBi)  \n\nAnyway. That's my \"evidence\" for why I doubt Josh Charles did anything as dramatic as dump Jennifer the night before the Oscars. It makes more sense that they broke up before awards season but decided to keep it quiet because who wants those headlines when you're campaigning for an Oscar?",

She had eaten something she wasn't supposed to eat. They had changed her food because she's grown-up now, and the food was not right yet. So I had the doctor come in the middle of the night.\n\n> KO: I'm glad she has 24-hour medical attention.\n\n> KL: The doctor had never seen a cat with so many people taking care of her. You know, she has two maids, and the driver takes care of her too.\n\n> KO: Are you surprised by how famous she's become?\n\n> KL: Unbelievable, no? She doesn't know.\n\n> KO: Are you sure she doesn't have an attitude?\n\n> KL: She has an attitude like a princess.\n\n> KO: Does she meow a lot, or is she a purrer?\n\n> KL: No, no, no‚Äîeverything is done with the eyes. She knows exactly what she wants.\n\n> KO: Tell me about her eating habits.\n\n> KL: She goes in the kitchen and sits in front of the food. She doesn't like to eat on the floor, so I have to put the food on the table. Her dishes are by Goyard. She has one for water, one for her little croquette, and one for her p√¢t√©. You have to serve everything, and she makes a choice.\n\n> KO: Does she have a favorite person besides you?\n\n> KL: I hope not! But, yes, the two maids, especially one called Fran√ßoise. They spend hours together and do her beauty jobs, her hair, and all those things, and they have moments of tenderness with her. They have to write in the book exactly what they're doing. Because there's a diary, I know everything.\n\n> KO: Does she get brushed a lot?\n\n> KL: Yes, she has to. You know, she has long white hair. Two times a day.\n\n> KO: Has she ever used Klorane hair powder like you?\n\n> KL: No, never. That's not necessary. Anyway, everything with a spray she hates. Room spray or even perfume‚Äîshe hates it!\n\n> KO: She doesn't like Chanel No. 5?\n\n> KL: No, no, no. She likes the smell of juicy food.\n\n> KO: So what does she play with?\n\n> KL: She likes strange toys, toys that aren't supposed to be toys. She plays with pieces of wood, pieces of paper, shopping bags. She loves shopping bags.\n\n> KO: Are they all Chanel?\n\n> KL: No, her favorite one is a huge Colette shopping bag that's under the kitchen table. She spends hours in there and brings all her toys in there. And when I'm in bed, sometimes she comes and brings all her toys in my bed.\n\n> KO: She must have met a lot of people in the fashion industry by now.\n\n> KL: Yes, everybody wants her, but I say no! She's really a stunning beauty. Her eyes are blue, blue, blue, blue, blue. And also her movement is so beautiful.\n\n> KO: Does she scratch? Does she have claws?\n\n> KL: Yes, the doctor does her manicure. She hates when we do it ourselves. The only time she makes a scandal is then.\n\n> KO: How much time a day does she spend sleeping?\n\n> KL: Quite a lot. I don't know; I'm not there all the time. But when I'm working, she sits next to me. And when I want to write letters, she sits on the papers because she doesn't want me to write letters.\n\n> KO: She wants attention!\n\n> KL: Exactly.\n\n> KO: Do you wish you'd gotten a cat sooner?\n\n> KL: No, I never thought I would like cats.\n\n> KO: Because you're a dog person?\n\n> KL: I love dogs, but dogs, you have to be in the country with dogs. I cannot walk a dog on the street. Cats take better care of themselves; they like to be alone. Cats are better in the house.\n\n> KO: Would you ever think about getting a second cat?\n\n> KL: No, no, no, no, no. She's the one.",

Again, Gilded Glamour was dress code NOT theme. \n\nAnd because of this, Kylie‚Äôs look gets so much hate when really, it was one of the few that tied both the theme and dress code together. Her look was a nod to the late Virgil Abloh, the founder of off-white. Off white is a prominent brand in the US and this look really highlights the popularity of ‚Äústreet fashion‚Äù mixing with high fashion in the modern 2000s in America. I interpret the bridal feel of this look mixed with the off white T-shirt to be a magnum opus of ‚Äúluxury streetwear‚Äù. \n\nHer baseball cap is again a dual piece, both a nod to America as a country (their national sport is baseball) but also bringing back the streetwear style. It‚Äôs very on-the-nose but that‚Äôs the point of the met gala. \n\nToo many people misunderstood this look and I will die on the hill that it is genius.",

Camp is something that says \"Yes, I know you think this is silly, and that makes me love it even MORE!\" Musicals are often campy because, duh, they're *musicals* and breaking into song at random points of a show is inherently silly so you have to just embrace that. Camp is also usually exaggerated in some way beyond all practicality. If you're making a campy ballgown, it better have the biggest, poofiest skirt you've ever seen! A campy high school movie might have a Jock Bully who speaks exclusively in insults and threats, and gets one-hit-KOd by the sensitive theater kid at the end of the movie, who cleverly turns the bully's insult around back at him at the same time. \n\nCamp takes the essential components of a thing and makes them 10x bigger, brighter and flashier as a way of showing your love and appreciation for that thing in spite of any mockery or derision you've received for loving it. Camp is all about doing the MOST, being unashamed, and authentically embracing even the goofiest and most mockable elements. So I hope this helps you understand why Karlie's dress is NOT it!",

But I think she shows up because she wants to be ‚Äúit‚Äù (who doesn‚Äôt want to be desirable?) but she anticipates not being enough, so she leans into the self deprecation and dulls her shine on purpose as a result.\n\nEdit: words are hardüíÄ",

So for me‚Ä¶\n\nChloe Bailey is not giving as Dany. Not even remotely. Just be a space sex robot or whatever?\n\nCharlotte McKinney is not giving as Mia. Mia wore pants and a loose shirt with a bustier and she should look messier. TBH I went as Mia mid-overdose one year and I had a super messy wig, running eye make-up and the bleeding nose. So many compliments on my lewk! \n\nAlso hate the sexy Snow White. Borrrrring. \n\nKourtney was hilarious! So good. \n\nKeke looked amazing! \n\nI loved the Britney costumes! Women unite! And THAT is how you do sexy: pick a sexy look to emulate. \n\nThe Barbie costume was cute but obvious. \n\nThe Kill Bill costumes were excellent but points off for trying to stick it to SAG-Aftra.",

Like sharing random details of their relationship that people say it‚Äôs TMI and for attention. And they have had public breakups/issues then get back together. \n\nIMO, it‚Äôs more of a Reddit/online thing than anything else. It is very much people who complain about media that they choose to engage with. On top of that it‚Äôs people believing that, once again, they know what‚Äôs best for people they do not know because an article comes out every few months. \n\nIf ppl knew half the shit that actually happened in relationships they would hate most couples. And before anyone says ‚Äúat least normal ppl don‚Äôt make it public!‚Äù, they are celebrities‚Ä¶being famous is their job‚Äîeven if it‚Äôs in a way you do not like. They are doing a great job bc guess what? You‚Äôre still complaining about them and giving them attention.",

So like Keke being the bride of Frankenstein might not have been malicious, nor was (I think) Cindy Crawford being Sandy from Grease ‚Äî there‚Äôs plausible deniability that maybe they just didn‚Äôt understand the assignment. \n\nBut Megan deliberately dressing in a Tarantino character‚Äôs costume and *tagging* SAG-AFTRA was her basically telling the union to go fuck themselves. \n\nAnd it worked, you know? Because here we all are talking about an almost 20 year old film that we hadn‚Äôt thought or talked about in years, and I bet a lot of regular folks are going to watch it since they just got reminded of it. So the corporate execs, the streaming services, and that rat bastard Weinstein (if he can make income in prison, IDK) just got more money in the bank because of her stunt. \n\nSo to all the folks saying SAG was being pedantic or trivial, nope. They were right on the money. \n\nAnd folks who are in the relevant unions are struggling to keep their homes while the unions try to negotiate better wages and rights, so it‚Äôs a slap in the face to all of us who have been out of work and are sweating keeping food on the table. I‚Äôm not even in SAG, but my union can‚Äôt work if the actors or writers are on strike‚Äî but I‚Äôm in solidarity with them.",

This woman still poses in wild innovative outfits at 72 years old looking like a total fox!!! Heaven and Hell events, 11/11 parties, Bartschland, and the random appearances she would make.. documentaries, red carpets. The woman is an icon. \n\nMy friend from theatre school in NY was and is a drag Queen, and introduced me into these amazing personalities and the innovation they had to offer. Dive into the world of drag/vogue/club kid culture beyond Drag race. Sexuality, politics, religion aside(although that is important to recognize and address). These people created a deep, pop-culture influencing universe that we all take fashion advice linguistic slang from. They get off the clock from every day life and spend the rest of their time living as art, and committing to the characters and pieces they crate/collaborate on. It‚Äôs inspiring to see them thriving and having fun despite what‚Äôs happening around them.  Very brave indeed.",

        "body": "I think the idea of a muse has been distorted and weaponised by toxic masculinity, the patriarchy, and whatever god complex these ‚Äútormented artists‚Äù have. It seems culturally to have been a way to both idolise and vilify women (the Madonna/Whore complex), to simultaneously sexualise them by worshipping their beauty (or other characteristics) while minimising their contribution to the male artist and culturally a dismissive sort of thing. So, yeah, I feel a bit uneasy when I see modern people use the word to describe a relationship because I feel like there‚Äôs a bit of ickiness in our cultural treatment of women, creatives, and the intersection.\n\nHowever when you consider the archetypal creative impulse, it is closely linked to sexual desire, lust, and intimacy. I was listening to an audiobook just today that talks about sexual arousal is a base instinct that you learn to transmute and channel into creative projects (painting, writing, singing, gardening etc). I think any artist or even a human who has ever experienced infatuation knows that the feelings of love and desire and primal urges become incredibly fertile ground for creativity and self expression. Think of how many songs and poems there are about love in all forms. I know a few years ago I experienced an infatuation that made me feel so alive and connected to my creativity and joy in a way I didn‚Äôt know I could. Sooo I‚Äôm a woman artist who hopes to one day find a loving supportive relationship that fuels my creative fires‚Ä¶ I.e a muse\n\nSo I feel like there is some truth to it all. It hasn‚Äôt been invented by dirtbag tortured artists who think with their dicks, but it has been publicly misused to justify some pretty morally gross behaviour (thinking Picasso here, plus the countless drunk and abusive poets and writers).\n\nI do laugh at your comment, and the others asking about health insurance etc, because it is funny to think about these historical people being like ‚Äúmmm, I‚Äôve got another offer on the table, so what are you offering?‚Äù \nBut I think the sad reality (for some examples anyway) was/is that the artist is so conceited and self absorbed that it doesn‚Äôt really matter about the muse anyway. Hopefully these days it means that ‚Äúmuses‚Äù are participating willingly and with a sense of their own self outside of that particular dynamic.",

It‚Äôs one thing to not accept how she looks it‚Äôs another thing to send the message that she‚Äôs only acceptable when she‚Äôs not dealing with an event she can‚Äôt control.

Unless you know you've been exposed or are exhibiting symptoms, you have to specifically ask for a herpes test. Why? Because you probably have it and are asymptomatic, but once you know, they have to prescribe you anti-virals. \n\nAlso herpes can be spread by many means beyond unprotected penetrative sex. There's no way to accurately hold one person responsible for infection. Accusing Usher of purposely spreading herpes, and treating infection as a death sentence akin to HIV in the 80s is dangerous and ignorant.",

Perhaps she‚Äôs not a talented song writer, but she definitely has a savvy business mind to manage to stay sort of relevant and famous through all these years.. maybe some of the fame came from let‚Äôs say less than traditional ways, - but honestly she isn‚Äôt the first, or the last to do it that way.- and she has stayed true to her friends, and supported her family throughout it all.

I don‚Äôt know her personally, but if I had to guess I would say she is a woman who knows how to work and maintain her level of press coverage. She avoids over exposure because she doesn‚Äôt flood your social media feeds with every thought that pops into her head. But she knows where and when to appear - an interview with British Vogue here, a tv hosting gig there. This isn‚Äôt all her doing - I dare say a fair chunk of it is down to her agent, management, PR person etc. But that woman works for her image, and that part of the celebrity machine certainly gets overlooked by the public.",

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I LOVE his earlier filmography and a lot of his TV series are my absolute favourites. I think he‚Äôs very talented at what he does. The shine just seems to have had a few years ago now seems to have worn off. He just doesn‚Äôt have the fan base he used to have. I think he‚Äôll get the Lin Manuel Miranda treatment soon enough. I believe love and thunder was a bigger blow to his career than we realise. His relationship with Rita Ora just adds to his ‚Äúcringe factor‚Äù, especially amongst gen Z. I think some of that can be chalked up to classic, good old fashioned internalised misogyny if I‚Äôm honest. Then there‚Äôs the faux pas they‚Äôve both made recently (taika liking the Johnny Depp Instagram post, the interview where he slagged off the SFX in Love and Thunder, Rita breaking lockdown rules etc‚Ä¶). I think he‚Äôs lost a lot of appeal, which will reflect badly on her, since he is a massive reason she has managed to cling to relevancy. \n\nI have a bit of a soft spot for the guy, so I think it‚Äôs a shame that he‚Äôs not really seen as ‚Äúhot property‚Äù now. He‚Äôs a complicated figure and there‚Äôs a part of me that finds that oddly relatable. He‚Äôs put out some beautiful work in the past. I hope he gets the chance to put out more stuff like jojo rabbit, hunt for the wilderpeople, reservation dogs and our flag means death. I hope he regains a bit of the popularity he had a few years ago. I‚Äôm just not sure it‚Äôs going to be possible for either of them to have a career comeback at this point.",

I highly doubt she would‚Äôve garnered half her publicity/fame without her numerous body modifications and the plastic surgery she‚Äôs had done on her face.\n\nYou make it sound like she's some prostitute. Nicki Minaj changing her body has less to do with being able to market it for money, and more to do with the unattainable beauty standards that ALREADY EXISTED (and will continue to exist) in hip hop and in Hollywood in general. I'm sure before Nicki underwent all the surgery, she was a victim of the toxic messaging about how female bodies should look. She is speaking from experience of having made those changes and come out with wisdom she didn't already have as a very young woman trying to make it in a male dominated medium. I think you should try to have some empathy for this person rather than demonize her as the villain of the perennial fucked up beauty standards in Hollywood.",

        "body": "Well it does make a difference because explantation to remove implants and reductions to remove natural breast tissue are driven by different types of problems and discomfort caused by both. For example, people may remove implants due to autoimmune issues related to their body reacting to the foreign body, or due to capsular contracture or other issues with the implants, or because they regret implants for some other reason. One might elect to have a reduction, on the other hand, because of the back pain related to the weight of the breast tissue, sagging, changes after pregnancy, asymmetry, inability to fit clothes in a way they may prefer, inability to find fitting clothes period, or because they are an athlete or something, or a whole slew of other reasons. But it‚Äôs not a reversal of a prior choice of plastic surgery. Something like breast implant illness is a phenomenon experienced only by those with implants and I believe the only way to fix it would be explantation.\n\nI think u/Special-Garlic1203 may have meant that people talking about their choice in explantation may help others curious about implants be more aware of some of the risks or realities of having implants. It‚Äôs important because sharing information may help young women and girls make better informed decisions about their body and health.",

        "body": "Yes, but his has a bit of a gay version given that pearls are often used to refer to male baby juice. So while Doja's could've been anything and dramatic, if you look at his costume a bit it has a bit of ironic flare regarding the association of sperm with pearls, his being the pearl boy, literally drenched pearls. I felt like his getup was combining gay maritime lore, of which there's a lot, his combining the tale of the pearl boy, the merman/Siren lore with the sailors and the euphemism of male love juice regarded as family jewels. The more I look at him, the more obvious it becomes his outfit is an homage to gay sensuality or rather how it's been referred in many mediums.\n\nNow, if he'd only tag team with The Village People. Can you imagine this handsome walking in a captain's uniform along with five other men wearing equally quirky costumes? Plus, if he did a performance of \"In the Navy\" with them? I would die. So would everyone else as who in the world hates the Village People?! They're in their 60s, maybe 70s, actually, I think most are dead save the leader; an homage to them would be adorable, I think. He loves trolling people, and \"In the Navy\" is the ultimate trolling song, and it's catchy. He would make a lot of money making conservative traditionalists cry while chanting, \"We WANT YOU, WE WANT YOU AS A NEW RECRUIT!\". I need this as an MTV VMA perfomance, it would single handedly make it relevant again. üòÜ  Or what if he changed genres again and did an homage to sailor lore by singing Sade's \"No Ordinary Love\" and being the siren/merman causing hot sailors to happily fling themselves to their deaths to adorn him in their pearls...can you tell I really do love how he entertains. I mean, it's so much fun: He loves making fun of bigots so much to have made it his entire shtick and we love him for it. \n\nAlso, maybe my little sister's yaoi fix is rubbing on too?\n\n**After making this comment, I went online and found out Lil Nas declared himself a \"power bottom\" sort of recently. So this confirms that this getup is likely to be an homage to that. He's fashionably telling the world he likes to be drenched...in...ahem...pearls. \n\nMe too man, mee too. \n\nHis lips remind me of that Dave Chapelled meme where his mouth is covered in crack except that from afar this sort of reminded me when one's mouth is glazed in...I know I'm not reading too much into it or maybe I am as that's what it looks like the more I look at him. God, I'm to hell aren't I? I can't wait to see how he explains this.\n\nUpdate: Apparently, he was inspired by a cat. A cat. And he looks like this? He's walking around in a thong, covered in pearls, looking like that, and he's saying his inspiration was a cute, very floofy bougie dead man's CAT?! Bruh. Nah. I will pretend I didn't read that as it was blasphemy and I don't buy it. I will pretend he went as some sort of sea monster siren who pulled a Killmonger and instead of cutting himself maybe added a pearl on his body to celebrate every kill and a crystal for every failure. Promoting the true inspiration of \"The Little Mermaid\" (Andersen's tale was sort of reflective of his craving another man's attention. The \"Chanel\" quality would've been the pearls). I wonder if the cat was a guest, and does it wear a Chanel pearl collar to represent her former owner's employer? That would've been adorable of the Gala if they did, especially if they held her at the leader's sear where staff would feed it and take care of it while the guests would pet it and honor her former master. It would've been adorably quirky but so much fun if they decided to celebrate by also having the cat being there. I'd actually envy their being there partying with a cat celebrating her owner's creativity. \n\nArticle explaining Lil Nas' costume:\n https://pagesix.com/2023/05/01/lil-nas-x-is-nearly-naked-and-covered-in-crystals-on-met-gala-2023-red-carpet/",

If anyone tried to wear the burger or the chandelier to the Met, even if it was someone beloved like Beyonce or Rihanna or Taylor Swift, they would get dragged SO hard. But I honestly can't imagine Katy Perry doing anything seriously. Her entire brand is just random and unserious and the day she shows up to the Met with a serious and gorgeous interpretation of the theme like Blake or Gigi would, we would all be extremely unsettled. Only Katy Perry with the image she had throughout the 2000s and 2010s could pull that off. \n\nDoja Cat is trying to go down the same random, quirky route and it just doesn't work with her either. You can tell she's trying so hard.",

Major miss IMO to diversify the event and add interest w modern interpretations of those looks.\n\n- **Guests I was desperately missing:** CLAUDIA FUCKING SCHIFFER, Christy Turlington, Linda Evangelista, Alex Wek, Cate Blanchett, Tilda Swinton, Zendaya, Bella Hadid, Alexa Demie, Meg Thee Stallion\n\n- *Overall, I was looking for more of what we got from Anne Hathaway*, who I think was the best look of the night. Her aesthetic was pretty exceptional from head to toe, from the bombshell Brigitte Bardot hair and makeup (with the delightful black Chanel bow nod) to that drool-worthy Chanel tweed mashed with iconic Versace bodice & safety pins.

Now celebrities are pivoting away from carrying Birkins because it's a practical necessity of the new rich (and has suffered from so many knockoffs most people assume they're fake if they see them in public).\n\nKanye being allowed to bring Kim as a guest was a chink in the armor and now, between the cost of attendance rising and random Instagram and TikTok influencers being formally invited? It is just a who's who of social climbers in a way that repels the actual personalities that people are interested in with respect to the idea of celebrity.\n\nI think it can be fixed, but it's pretty clear like many things that have been struggling to survive in the age of microcelebrities, the people responsible refuse to give up their power or listen to the voices of younger people who can provide the insight necessary to ensure the change is beneficial.\n\nAlso ngl it seems like Anna might not be as in control of the outfits as she used to be (requiring photos of everyone's looks so she could avoid two people dressing the same, veto power, etc.) and it's really hurt the esteem. I guess it was that one swimsuit model (was it Decker????) buying her way in was the real \"chink in the armor\" moment and Kim attending with Kanye was what caused the armor to break, but the point still stands that the accessibility of the event to people who aren't actual A list celebs has really hurt the event.",

I'm not a big fan of her nor hates her, it's actually impressive how she'd done all that in just a year.\n\nAlso, she and PinkPantheress boomed at the same time(i think) but is more successful in comparison.\n\nedit: OMG, Ice Spice is going to be featured on Taylor's song Karma. Like imagine hearing \"stop playing with em riot\" and \"grah\" on itüôàüòª. But isn't Taylor's alleged bf insulted her?  But anyways Ice Spice is growing on me and I'm happy that she's thriving.",

        "body": "Well the first time Ice Spice went truly viral was the Buss It challenge, so it was known from the beginning that she had some type of mass appeal. She released a couple of songs after that but didn‚Äôt make much noise. This is all in 2021/early 2022. Then ‚ÄúMunch‚Äù came out and went viral in late summer 2022 and it was off from there. This was many months before ‚ÄúBoy‚Äôs a liar pt. 2‚Äù came out, but I would say that‚Äôs probably her official debut to people outside of twitter and tiktok lmao. It all happened very very quick, the only other rapper I‚Äôve seen rise to fame this quick was Cardi B, but she already had multiple mixtapes and an online fan base before ‚ÄúBodak Yellow‚Äù blew up. \n\nThe reasoning is colorism and charisma. She‚Äôs pretty and light-skinned with a fun personality, so she‚Äôs seen as more marketable and ‚Äúfamily-friendly‚Äù despite the fact that she does the same thing as everyone else, and usually not as well. She really does have some catchy songs though imo. They aren‚Äôt lyrical masterpieces, but I don‚Äôt really care either way when it comes to fun turn up songs. And as per usual with the rap girlies, her singles are her worst songs. They always push the least creative songs to be singles. \n\nTLDR; It‚Äôs all about money and the music industry‚Äôs backwards views on marketing WOC",

But fortunately rap music can be very diverse and she's never claimed to be or want to be the best. She makes music that she likes and I got that from day 1.

I think beyond her being a good person (as far as we know), her decent amount of talent and songs earned her her moment. No doubt Ice benefitted from colorism (hell, most of her black cosigner's also benefitted from colorism such as Drake, PinkPatheresses, Nicki, etc), but your comment veers on discrediting her success for being light skinned, when at the end of the day she didn't choose her skin color. The whole \"light skinned girls like Ice Spice winning thanks to colorism while dark skin girls like Flo Milli lose\" is kinda tired, especially when darker women are used as props against their lighter counterparts yet don't get any of the genuine support outside of those arguments. I'm not trying to shade you, but it's something to think about for any readers of these comments who are thinking of using dark skinned women to bring down light skinned women without actually supporting them in any meaningful way, I guess.",

Her music isn‚Äôt anything new, fresh or unique, but because she‚Äôs pretty and light skinned she‚Äôs a sensation and has already been invited to the Met Gala. I don‚Äôt see that for many of the other countless (more) talented black female rappers I see who are dark skinned. \n\nThis phenomenon will never get tired as long as it keep happening. When does unfair discrimination become ‚Äòtired‚Äô? When does addressing colourism and aiming to give those who deserve their flowers their flowers become ‚Äúusing dark skinned women to bring down light skinned women‚Äù? I support both Ice Spice and Flo Milli outside of this debate as well as other female rappers of all different shades, but (as you know) you can‚Äôt shy away from the fact that colourism is rampant in the music industry whether it‚Äôs obvious or not.",

I think a lot of it had to do with what played well in middle America - or rather, what tabloid editors and Joan Rivers thought played well with middle America. I feel like ending up on a worst dressed list used to be much more harmful to a celebrity‚Äôs career than it does now (and especially if said celebrity was an up and coming actress). Now you have Florence Pugh wearing whatever the hell she wants on the red carpet, because 1) her social media means she has other ways to appeal to fans other than just being a pretty clotheshorse, and 2) the general public is more accustomed to seeing out-there looks now.",

So if anyone is super into the Met Gala and wants to feel the prep vibes, I recommend visiting the Sunday before next year!

        "body": "She's not narrow and has a straight figure, which fashion usually tries to manipulate to look otherwise by breaking it up or adding details to distract and downplay it. Her style strategy is wearing the eccentric fashions people aren't used to seeing a woman with her body type wearing as again, women with her figure are usually told to wear specific cuts to downplay their figure or alter them into another shapelier figure. Instead, she's just having fun with clothes, adorning herself in things that she likes despite not flattering her figure. It's not that fashion doesn't make things for her, they do, it's just that she doesn't want to wear them nor focus on \"figure flattery\" as the things that \"flatter\" a straight figure aren't fun and eccentric normally. She's trying to stick out in hollywood as someone carefree, willing to show off the goods even if she doesn't quite look their ideals. She's not caring and wearing what she wants even if it frames her body oddly as she seems to not like the harmony strategy. Which makes sense for her as her figure not being traditionally favored puts her at a disadvantage in being seen for \"sex appeal.\" She turns it around by dressing in things that conventionality thinks she shouldn't wear as an act of defiance. Wear things because she likes them and forcing people to respect her body/beauty by just embracing the body she was in, not hiding it or changing it. She's using fashion as an opportunity to represent the women Hollywood stubbornly ignores by owning herself and that she was chosen by one of their own. She might not be what Hollywood's ideal of a sexy dream girl, but she's presenting herself as she is. Dressing like any young woman would dream of dressing and proudly showcasing her figure as a celebration/pride of herself, I mean, look at her doing amazing things in a vain industry. Unexpectedly but not surprising, her mood is helping a lot of women not feel ashamed about their bodies. She's sort of being Prometheus for them by forcing fashion to see her as the beauty she sees herself and it is working. \n\nHer gambling works for her as her willingness to wear anything/anyone, regardless if it works with her body, makes fashion houses want to work with her as she gets them attention. She looks outlandish and sometimes ridiculous, but it gets her attention, and by extension, the brands she's wearing bask on that attention. She gains a following of fans besotted for her not \"caring\" to work with beauty conventionality, hilding herlsef as is as a beauty. Her resolve to have fun with clothes eventually gets publicity starved designers to make the quirky clothes she wants to wear.\n\nShe's an unusual case in an industry that typically disdains her figure type as they find it limiting in fashion when it's not narrow. The straight shape is the best figure to have when it comes to fashion when you're narrow but honestly it's a different ballgame when it's wide as historically speaking people have never liked the wide variant, ever, despite being the most common body type across the board with some 40-something percent of the world's women having it. You rarely see it represented in media, art, anything, which is why Flo sticks out and has garnered a following of fans who usually feel left out of the fashion conversation.",
